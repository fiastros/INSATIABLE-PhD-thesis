\section{Livestock farming, animal health and infectious diseases}

\subsection{Socio-economical context and the stakes}

Livestock farming is a cornerstone of agricultural systems, essential for food production and the livelihood of many communities. However, modern farming faces a dual challenge: ensuring high levels of animal health and well-being while transitioning toward sustainable, self-sufficient practices. In this section, I will first give a general context on livestock farming , ...
I will outline 
%the socio-economic impacts our work could have.


\subsubsection{Livestock Farming, animal health well-being}

First, we define the core concepts:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Livestock Farming: The organized breeding and raising of animals for food, fiber, and other products.
    \item Animal Health and Well-Being: The physical and psychological state of animals, which directly impacts productivity and the quality of the products.
    \item Sustainable/Self-Sufficient Livestock Farming: Farming systems that are designed to maintain productivity and animal health over the long term with minimal reliance on external inputs, promoting environmental, economic, and social resilience.
\end{itemize}


Next, we examine why sustainable livestock farming is critical in today’s global context:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Food Security: As the global population grows, the demand for high-quality animal products increases. Ensuring that farming practices are sustainable helps guarantee that future generations will have access to sufficient, nutritious food. This involves not only meeting quantity demands but also maintaining quality standards.
    \item Animal Welfare and public Health: The safety of the food supply is paramount. Sustainable practices reduce the risks of diseases that can be transmitted between animals and humans. Maintaining robust animal health also minimizes the use of interventions, such as antibiotics, which can lead to issues like antibiotic resistance.
    \item Environmental and Ecological Management: Livestock farming significantly contributes to environmental challenges such as greenhouse gas emissions, pollution, and deforestation. Transitioning to sustainable systems can mitigate these impacts, balancing food production with the need to preserve natural ecosystems.
    \item Resource Management: Efficient farming requires the optimal use of resources—land, water, energy, and labor. Sustainable systems are designed to reduce waste and improve efficiency. This is particularly important as both the availability of resources and the demand for skilled labor (veterinarians, farmers, technicians) face increasing pressures in many parts of the world.
\end{itemize}

By addressing these interrelated aspects, sustainable livestock farming not only tackles immediate socio-economic challenges but also contributes to long-term ecological balance and public health protection.

\subsubsection{Infectious diseases - impact on livestock farming}

Infectious diseases are disorders caused by pathogenic microorganisms—such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites—that can spread directly or indirectly from one host to another. These diseases can manifest across different domains, affecting both humans and animals, and their transmission may occur at multiple scales—from within a single host to entire metapopulations.

\textbf{Types and Transmission Patterns:} Infectious diseases vary by type. For instance, respiratory infections (e.g., COVID-19 in humans and certain respiratory illnesses in animals) and sexually transmitted diseases (such as AIDS in humans) illustrate the diversity of these conditions. In the animal domain, examples like African swine fever and bovine viral diarrhea underscore how pathogens can devastate livestock. Some infections are zoonotic, meaning they can jump from wildlife to livestock and even to humans (e.g., Ebola, monkeypox), highlighting the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health. Transmission can occur in several ways, including host-to-host contact, within-host dynamics, and across populations, which sometimes creates complex patterns that pose significant public health challenges.

The effects of infectious diseases are far-reaching:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ecological Impact: Inappropriate or excessive use of antimicrobials in response to infections can lead to the emergence of resistant bacteria. This resistance not only renders certain treatments ineffective but also complicates recovery, thereby jeopardizing both animal and human health.
    \item Food Safety and Security: Outbreaks can cause major production losses in livestock farming by reducing both the quality and quantity of animal products. These losses threaten the broader goal of achieving food security, especially in regions where livestock is a primary source of nutrition and income
    \item Animal Health and Welfare: Infectious diseases directly compromise the health and well-being of animals, leading to suffering and significant economic losses for farmers.
    \item Resource Management: Managing infectious diseases demands frequent monitoring and diagnosis, along with substantial investments in vaccines, antibiotics, and veterinary expertise. This imposes a heavy financial and operational burden on farming systems, making sustainable practices even more challenging to implement.
\end{itemize}

By understanding these aspects, one recognizes that controlling infectious diseases is not only a matter of public health but also a critical component of creating sustainable and self-sufficient livestock farming systems.

\subsection{Conventional control strategies of infectious diseases}
\label{Conventional control strategies} % ajout-du-label-pour-faire-reference-a-la-sous-section

\subsubsection{Diagnose, prognose and recommend control measures}

Effective management of infectious diseases in livestock relies on a systematic process that begins with accurate diagnosis, proceeds with reliable prognosis, and culminates in tailored recommendations for control measures. Each step is crucial for mitigating outbreaks and ensuring the long-term sustainability of farming systems.

\paragraph{Diagnosis.} The first step involves identifying the presence and nature of the disease. Diagnosis can be achieved through:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Clinical Appraisal: This is the most common method among farmers, where visual or tactile observations are used to detect clinical signs in animals. While this approach is quick and accessible, it is inherently subjective and may lead to inconsistent interpretations.
    \item Biological Examinations: In this approach, samples such as blood or mucus are collected for laboratory analysis (e.g., PCR testing). Although this method can provide a more precise identification of pathogens, it is often more invasive, time-consuming, and may delay decision-making during fast-moving outbreaks.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Prognosis.} Once the disease is diagnosed, the next step is to forecast its progression and potential impact. Prognosis typically relies on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Expert Knowledge: Veterinarians draw on empirical observations and scientific experimentations (detail more how they build knowledge pieces by pieces) knowledge, to predict the disease trajectory.
    \item Historical Data: Farmer can also rely on past events and past decision outcomes to help inform the likely spread of the disease. 
    % though variability between farms or over time can challenge generalization and accuracy.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Recommendation of Control Measures.} Based on the diagnostic and prognostic assessments, appropriate control measures can be devised. These measures are intended to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reduce the spread of the disease within and between farms.
    \item Minimize production losses and safeguard food safety.
    \item Optimize the use of resources such as veterinary expertise, time, and financial investment.
    \item Balance short-term emergency responses with long-term sustainable practices
\end{itemize}

While these conventional methods have proven useful, they come with inherent limitations.

\textit{\textbf{Keywords:}} Diagnosis, clinical appraisal, biological examinations, prognosis, expert knowledge, empirical observations, scientific experimentations, recommendations, control measures.


\subsubsection{Challenges to tackle}

\paragraph{Limitations in Diagnosis:} 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Subjectivity and Inconsistency: Visual and manual examinations by farmers or experts, though common, are inherently subjective. Different observers may interpret clinical signs in various ways, leading to inconsistent diagnoses.
    \item Scalability Issues: Manual diagnosis becomes increasingly impractical as farm sizes grow or when frequent assessments are necessary. This limitation is critical as rising demand requires more rapid and consistent monitoring.
    \item Intrusiveness and Delay in Biological Testing: Biological examinations (e.g., blood sampling and PCR testing) offer greater precision but are invasive and time-consuming. The time lag in obtaining results can allow the disease to progress before control measures are implemented.
\end{itemize}

Challenges in Prognosis:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Limited Expertise and Resource Constraints: Relying on expert judgment for prognosis is not scalable. The shortage of veterinarians, especially in rural areas, exacerbates the challenge of providing timely and accurate prognoses across large populations.
\end{itemize}

Addressing these challenges is essential for enhancing the reliability and scalability of disease management strategies.

\section{Artificial intelligence}

\subsection{Precision agriculture: hardware and sensors}

Precision agriculture represents an innovative approach to farming that focuses on optimizing inputs (such as feed, medication, and energy) while maximizing outputs, including net profit and environmental sustainability. This paradigm is rapidly being adopted in livestock farming to enhance decision-making and operational efficiency. At its core, precision agriculture is supported by a robust infrastructure consisting of both hardware and software components. In this subsection, we concentrate on the sensors that underpin data collection:


\begin{itemize}
    \item Behavioural Data: For instance, accelerometers can record movement patterns of individual animals.
    \item Positional Data: Electronic identification systems (such as Eartags) track animal locations and movement across the farm.
    \item Biological Data: Devices like intraruminal boluses can continuously monitor physiological metrics such as body temperature.
    \item Environmental Data: Connected sensors measure ambient conditions, such as temperature and humidity, which can influence animal health.
    \item Operational Data: Information regarding feeding schedules and management practices can also be recorded to provide a comprehensive picture of the farming environment.
\end{itemize}

One of the major benefits of these sensors is their configurability. They can be tailored to collect data at various spatial scales—from detailed individual observations to broader herd-level trends—and temporal resolutions, whether through continuous real-time monitoring or periodic measurements. This scalability ensures that both micro-level behaviours and macro-level patterns are captured effectively. 

By leveraging these advanced sensor systems, precision agriculture can provide a more objective, scalable, and comprehensive means of monitoring livestock health, thereby addressing some of the inherent limitations of conventional observational methods.

Although sensors deliver raw observational data that is closely linked to the emergence and spread of infectious diseases, a conceptual gap remains. The challenge lies in processing this unstructured, multi-dimensional data to extract meaningful insights and translate them into actionable recommendations.

\textit{\textbf{Keywords:}} sensors, automated data collection, multi-modal datasets, scalable, customizable.

% if you have more examples of sensors used in precision agriculture, then i shoudl insert it here. I don't want to mention anyy modelling strategies here nor do i want to mention any, just want to stay limited on the sensors and hardware so do you have any more ideas ? 

\subsection{Epidemiological modelling: Stochastic mechanistic models}

Epidemiological models serve as valuable tools for understanding, predicting, and controlling the spread of infectious diseases. By combining theoretical knowledge of disease transmission dynamics with empirical observations, these models provide insights that guide public health and veterinary interventions.

\paragraph{Fundamental Concepts and Historical Context.} Epidemiological modelling has deep roots in classical infectious disease research, with early examples focusing on simple compartmental models (e.g., SIR, SEIR). Over time, these models have evolved to capture more nuanced disease dynamics and real-world complexities. They explicitly represent the biological and ecological processes governing infection spread, such as contact rates, recovery patterns, and immunity mechanisms. By embedding domain knowledge, mechanistic models are interpretable and allow researchers to dissect how various factors influence disease trajectories.

\paragraph{Stochastic Mechanistic Models.} Stochastic approaches extend mechanistic models by incorporating random events—such as unpredictable contact opportunities, mutations, or interventions—thereby accounting for variability in disease spread. Key features include granular representation of uncertainty (Randomness in infection times and transmission events is captured, leading to a range of possible outcomes rather than a single deterministic trajectory). Stochastic models can better handle heterogeneous populations (e.g., different farms, varying animal susceptibility), especially when data are limited or events are sporadic. Scenario Exploration : Researchers can run multiple simulations under different assumptions or interventions, providing valuable insights into potential disease outcomes without requiring large-scale, real-world experimentation.

Interpretability and Biological Realism: By embedding expert knowledge and explicit mechanisms, these models help highlight the interactions and feedback loops that drive disease progression.

Hypothesis Testing and Policy Guidance: Stochastic mechanistic models allow for the evaluation of “what-if” scenarios, enabling more informed decisions on control measures—such as vaccination strategies or biosecurity protocols.

Although powerful, stochastic mechanistic models can become mathematically complex.

\textit{\textbf{Keywords:}} epidemiological stochastic mechanistic models, explicit representation of underlying mechanisms, incorporation of as much knowledge as we want, explainable predictions and insights, evidence-based recommendations, extrapolation


\subsubsection{Identifiability and observability}

Identifiability and observability are fundamental concepts in epidemiological modelling and statistical inference. They describe our ability to determine meaningful information about a system based solely on available observations (relire l'article de nik cunniffe et frederic hamelin)

Identifiability: Refers to whether the parameters of a model can be uniquely and accurately estimated from the available observations. In epidemiological modelling, a model is identifiable if different parameter values always lead to distinct observational outcomes. A lack of identifiability implies multiple plausible explanations exist for the same observed data, making reliable inference difficult.

Observability: Closely related to identifiability, observability refers specifically to the possibility of inferring the internal state of a system from available observations. An observable epidemiological model allows researchers to infer hidden states (e.g., the number of infected or susceptible animals at a given time) from external observations (e.g., clinical signs, ultrasound imaging, sensor data).

The challenges of identifiability and observability are central when modelling livestock diseases, as they directly affect the reliability of predictions, diagnoses, and recommended interventions. When parameters in a mechanistic epidemiological model cannot be reliably identified, the predictions become uncertain, undermining effective disease management.

Challenges of using epidemiological mechanistic models in Livestock farming:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Parameter inference, conversely, aims to estimate model parameters directly from context-specific observational data. It typically provides more precise results tailored to the studied population or outbreak but requires sufficient data quantity and quality, as well as more computational resources and advanced inferential methods. Real-world epidemiological models often have many parameters. As model complexity increases, the parameter space grows exponentially, a phenomenon known as the "curse of dimensionality." This makes it increasingly difficult to accurately infer parameters from observational data, especially when the quantity or quality of data is limited. 
    \item Manual Processing and Scalability Issues: often, methods including visual analysis or expert-driven parameter selection, are time-consuming and hard to scale. Manual identification of observable patterns or features from raw data becomes impractical when dealing with extensive datasets, particularly data derived from videos, audio recordings, or continuous sensor measurements. Livestock observational data, such as ultrasound imaging or audio recordings of animal coughs, often contain high levels of noise and unstructured information. Such data are challenging to interpretate even by experts, severely limiting scalability and accuracy.
\end{itemize}

\textit{\textbf{Keywords:}} Parameter identification, fitting to non-structured observations, differentiating models, manual model fitting does not scale-up.

Even thought these modelling approach are arguably the best to study and control complex diseases, they still have a few but critical challenges to be tackled. Being able to exploit their knowledge on non-structure observations (which are very frequent in the real-world) would also make them more widely used. 


\subsection{Machine learning modelling: Deep learning models}
Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence involving algorithms that allow computers to learn patterns or relationships directly from data. The defining characteristic of machine learning models is their ability to improve their predictive performance through exposure to increasing amounts of data, rather than through explicitly programmed instructions. Within machine learning, deep learning models represent a sophisticated subclass, specifically designed to handle complex, high-dimensional, and unstructured data. Deep learning employs artificial neural networks—computational models inspired by biological neural systems—which consist of interconnected processing units called neurons arranged in layered architectures. This hierarchical structure enables deep learning models to learn intricate data representations at multiple abstraction levels.

In this thesis, we give extra attention to deep learning architectures, for their high performance in data-mining, pattern extraction in unstructured data which are an efficient format for storing high dimensions observations in their closest form to the original state: "one image contains a thousand words". 
Deep learning models are exceptionally powerful in tasks requiring automatic pattern extraction, and they are frequently described as universal approximators, capable of capturing non-linear relationships and subtle features from large and varied datasets. Typical examples include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Image classification: Identifying objects or diseases from medical or veterinary images (e.g., ultrasound images).
    \item Natural language processing (NLP): Understanding and generating human language, such as sentiment analysis and text classification.
    \item Speech recognition: Automatically transcribing spoken audio signals.
\end{itemize}

There are methods implemented to enhance the explainability of deep learning models (XAI):
\begin{itemize}
    \item Grad-Cam and LIME produce saliency maps. They provide visual explanations by highlighting important regions of an input image that contribute to a neural network's prediction. Grad-CAM is specific to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and generates heatmaps by computing gradients of the predicted class score relative to the CNN's intermediate convolutional layers, emphasizing regions that strongly influence the prediction. In contrast, LIME is model-agnostic, working by creating local perturbations around the input data, fitting a simple interpretable model (such as a linear regression) to approximate the behaviour of the original model, and highlighting input regions that most significantly affect the prediction. They are several other methods, such as DeepLIFT (Deep Learning Important Features, SmoothGrad, occlusion sensitivity). 
    \item Uncertainty quantification such as Bayesian deep learning or conformal predictions. There is no rivalry. They are radically different frameworks achieving very different things. CP is about calibrating predictions, while the Bayesian framework is about quantifying uncertainty of various things from the model, parameters, and consequently, the predictions. The typical guarantee you get from the Bayesian framework is that your estimates/predictions achieve the smallest average loss over the prior. That means Bayesian estimators are optimal estimators in terms of average performance, meaning they will be accurate, but do not guarantee coverage. CP does nothing about the accuracy of your estimator but gives you coverage. You can combine both and have the best of both worlds. One can understand this from a PAC-Bayesian perspective: CP is related to the empirical risk, while BDL is related to the KL divergence between the posterior and prior. 
\end{itemize}

These examples illustrate the flexibility and adaptability of deep learning across multiple application domains, including precision agriculture and epidemiological diagnostics. Despite their remarkable capabilities, deep learning models present certain limitations critical in epidemiological and livestock farming contexts.

\subsubsection{Limitations and Challenges of classical Deep Learning Models}

% Interpolative vs extrapolative knowledge

Deep learning methods typically assume the data to be independently and identically distributed (iid), meaning each data point is generated from the same probability distribution and independently from one another. Deviations from this assumption can significantly degrade model performance and generalization capabilities.

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Lack of Interpretability and Biophysical Meaning: Deep learning models are often described as "black-box" models due to their complexity and limited interpretability. The learned parameters (weights and biases) generally do not possess direct biological or mechanistic meaning, making it difficult to understand why a model produces a certain prediction.
%     \item Overfitting and Generalization: With high capacity and flexibility comes the risk of overfitting, where the model learns dataset-specific noise or irrelevant patterns rather than meaningful generalizable trends. Consequently, achieving robust generalization performance beyond the training set can be challenging.
%     \item Requirement for Extensive and Representative Data: Deep learning models rely heavily on datasets that comprehensively represent the underlying phenomena of interest. Insufficient or biased training data can lead to suboptimal generalization, especially in disease diagnostics, where precise and representative datasets are rare, difficult to collect, or ethically challenging to generate (e.g., intentionally inducing disease outbreaks).
%     \item Sensitivity to Distribution Shifts (Out-of-Distribution Data): Deep learning models typically struggle when encountering data outside their training distribution (Out-of-Distribution, OOD). This limitation is particularly pertinent in epidemiology, where the appearance of previously unobserved disease variants or changes in environmental conditions frequently occur.
%     \item these methods can also quickly become very resource intensive particularly when dealing with complex task as often the architecture also get more complex, requiring bigger infrastructure (gpu, cpu) for training or inference, these also has an impact on environmental management.
% \end{itemize}

XAI methods are a way to measure and understand why predictions are made, They are usually are employed for outliers detection, data drift, ...  however they cannot be used to precisely forecast extreme scenarios. 

Each of these methodologies individually addresses certain specific aspects of infectious disease modelling effectively, but they also carry inherent limitations when applied alone:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Deep learning models excel at extracting intricate patterns from large-scale or high-dimensional observational data (e.g., sensor-derived data such as audio, video, or biological signals). Their data-driven nature allows them to effectively capture context-specific and complex relationships without explicit theoretical assumptions. Nevertheless, their main limitation lies in their lack of explicit biological or theoretical interpretability, limiting their capability to reliably extrapolate to unseen scenarios or out-of-distribution contexts.
    \item Stochastic mechanistic epidemiological models explicitly encode theoretical or biological mechanisms (infection transmission, recovery rates, or disease progression) using interpretable parameters with clearly defined biological meanings. These models can thus generate hypotheses, facilitate understanding of causal dynamics, and provide robust extrapolation to scenarios not explicitly observed in the data. However, their main challenge lies in effectively incorporating detailed, unstructured, and context-specific observational data (such as sensor data), limiting their practical utility and responsiveness to specific epidemiological contexts.
\end{itemize}

% Even thought these model are widely used to process complex datasets, they are hardly used to explore novel situations or predict task that are inherently has multiple complex relationships (so hard to gather a representative dataset). these challenges essentially stem from the lack of explicit knowledge incorporation (example hallucinations in LLMs). They are in their need of feature that could  enhance interpretability, improve generalization in OOD settings, and facilitate more accurate and meaningful insights by explicitly incorporating domain-specific knowledge into the learning process.


% do models like PINN require more data ? 
% otherwise the advantage of what we are proposing will be on the structure i guess. A modular method, that could require a bit less since we are training a a less complex task. at yet maybe as performant ? 

% prmireè formulation: a methodology that can be used to process non-structure datasets and still easily be used to extrapolate towards unknown complex scenarios.
% second thing incorporate more knowledge into the observation that are gathered because sometimes the observations are noisy and don't represent the global mechanisms. 

\textit{\textbf{Keywords:}} Generalization, forecast extreme scenarios, input dataset has to be iid, lack of biophysical meaning of parameters, black-box modelling, data intensive for complex tasks, resource intensive (GPU, electricity, materials...) for complex tasks, false positive, false negative, extrapolation


\subsection{Hybrid modelling: machine learning and epidemiological models}

This section serves as a concise narrative review of various methodologies for integrating machine learning models with epidemiological models, offering a critical perspective on their limitations. Addressing these limitations is central to the contributions of this thesis.

This section presumes that the reader possesses a foundational understanding of ensemble techniques in modelling, specifically bagging, boosting, and stacking. They are pivotal in enhancing the global performance by combining multiple models. These methods aim to reduce errors, improve accuracy, and increase the robustness of predictions. Stacking Combines outputs from several distinct models using an additional "meta-model," learning optimal combinations for improved predictions. Boosting refers to sequentially training multiple weak predictive models, each aiming to correct errors from previous models, thus progressively improving overall prediction accuracy. Bagging (or Bootstrap Aggregating) refers to parallel training of multiple unique models (while stacking used distinct models, bagging uses multiple instances but of the same model) on random subsets of data (with replacement), thereby reducing prediction variance and mitigating over-fitting.

In the scientific literature, hybrid modelling approaches integrating deep learning and mechanistic models have gained attention, especially during epidemiological crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Several prominent methodologies in this domain include:

En sciences, toute tentative de tirer des conclusions généralisables nécessite un
modèle, i.e. une version abstraite de la réalité \cite{McCallum2008}. Cette représentation
abstraite est dotée d’un objectif (a model is a "purposeful representation", 
\cite{Starfield1990}, qui requiert un certain degré de simplification.

The purposes of the hybrid models currently found in the litterature can be grouped into 6 mutually exclusive groups, indicating that a single integrated model serve multiple application areas \cite{Ye2025} :
\begin{itemize}
    \item Infectious disease forecasting: Predicting the future spread or trajectory of infectious diseases by combining AI's data-mining strengths with the explanatory power of mechanistic epidemiological models. \cite{Poirier2020, Fan2022, Garner2016, Kharazmi2021, Barmparis2022}
    \item Model Parameterization and Calibration: Determining and refining model parameters (e.g., disease transmissibility, contact rates) accurately and efficiently, often by extracting additional insights from diverse and complex datasets. \cite{Tuarob2015, SolaresHernandez2023, Reiker2021, Jorgensen2022, Raissi2019}
    \item Disease Intervention Assessment and Optimization: Evaluating and identifying optimal strategies for interventions (such as vaccinations, social distancing, or lockdowns) to minimize disease spread and impact, utilizing methods like reinforcement learning and game theory. \cite{Thiagarajan2022, Bertsimas2021, Aurell2022, Janko2023}
    \item Retrospective Epidemic Course Analysis: Understanding past epidemics by analyzing historical data, identifying critical factors influencing transmission dynamics, and informing future outbreak preparedness. \cite{Ruth2022, Santermans2015, Sanson2022, Weyant2023}
    \item Transmission Inference: Inferring hidden patterns, source origins, and transmission networks using AI techniques trained on data from mechanistic epidemiological simulations or real-world data. \cite{Ling2022, Colijn2014, Vilar2023}
    \item Outbreak Detection:Quickly identifying new outbreaks or unusual surges in cases, enabling timely public health responses through AI-enhanced analysis of varied data sources, such as medical reports or social media content.
\end{itemize}


Methodologicaly-wise, these models can also grouped into nine primary frameworks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item AI-augmented epidemiological models: These models directly replace (or augment) specific components (e.g., parameters or even entire sub-models) of the mechanistic framework with machine learning outputs. In many cases, the machine learning component is trained end‐to‐end alongside the mechanistic model or is integrated into the numerical solver (réfs heres). In an end-to-end configuration, the machine learning module’s weights are updated simultaneously with the mechanistic model’s parameters, creating a tightly coupled structure that learns both representation and dynamics jointly. 
    \item Epidemiological models with improved observational data: In these approaches, AI is applied to augment or “clean” raw data inputs before they feed into the mechanistic model. Techniques include using machine learning to extract features from social media, search trends, or satellite imagery(réfs heres). Machine learning operates as a pre-processor and the mechanistic model then uses the enhanced, higher-quality data for calibration and simulation. This is typically a weakly coupled integration because the machine learning module’s output is treated as a fixed input to the downstream mechanistic model rather than being jointly optimized with it.
    \item Physics-infromed neural networks (PINNs) and Epidemiology-aware AI models (EAAMs): These models embed the differential equations governing disease transmission directly into the loss function of the neural network (réfs heres). PINNs are effective when generalised to some PDEs, in particular nonlocal or high-dimensional PDEs, for which traditional solvers are computationally expensive. However, \cite{Kidger2021}  emphasises that this is a distinct notion to AI-augmented epidemiological models (AIEM). AIEMs use neural networks to specify differential equations. PINNs uses neural networks to obtain solutions to prespecified differential equations. This distinction is a common point of confusion, especially as the PDE equivalent of PINNs is sometimes referred to as a `neural partial differential equation'.
    \item Machine learning models incorporating epidemiological input features: In this configuration, traditional machine learning architectures (like recurrent neural networks or graph neural networks) are augmented by explicitly incorporating epidemiological features (e.g., contact rates, incubation periods) as additional inputs or via modified architectures. This represents a moderate or weak coupling since the epidemiological knowledge is “injected” as additional features rather than being deeply embedded in the model’s structure or loss function.
    \item Surrogate modelling/synthetically-trained ai models: Surrogate models use machine learning to approximate the outputs of computationally expensive mechanistic models. Typically, synthetic datasets are generated from simulations of the mechanistic model, and an machine learning model (often a neural network) is then trained on these data. The coupling here is often “loose” or weak because the AI surrogate is a stand-alone approximation that is later used in place of the full mechanistic model.
    \item Ensemble Learning Frameworks: Ensemble methods combine predictions from mechanistic models and machine learning models (or multiple ML models) using techniques like weighted averaging, stacking. The coupling is relatively loose since each model is usually developed independently and then combined at a later stage.
    \item Bayesian Neural Networks: These hybrid approaches integrate Bayesian inference with deep learning to quantify uncertainty in parameter estimation. In the epidemiological context, Bayesian neural networks are used to learn parameters while simultaneously providing credible intervals for model outputs.The coupling is inherent in the training process as the posterior distribution is approximated jointly using both data likelihood and prior mechanistic information.
    \item ML-Enhanced Optimization Frameworks: These methods use AI algorithms—such as reinforcement learning, optimal control, or Markov decision processes—to optimize intervention strategies based on outputs from mechanistic models.In an end-to-end framework, the AI agent interacts with the mechanistic simulation in a closed loop, receiving feedback and updating its strategy iteratively (tight coupling).Alternatively, the optimization can be performed in a decoupled fashion where the mechanistic model is used to generate scenarios and the AI module optimizes the intervention based on pre-computed results (weaker coupling).
    \item Cluster-Based Transmission Analysis Frameworks: This approach uses unsupervised learning methods (such as k-means clustering) to segment populations or regions with similar transmission characteristics. Once clusters are identified, mechanistic models are applied to each subgroup to refine forecasts or intervention strategies.
\end{itemize}

These findings can be summarized into a table \ref{tab:integration_methods}:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs): PINNs integrate known governing equations (e.g., differential equations describing infectious dynamics) as soft constraints into neural networks during training. The neural network is guided by both observed data and theoretical knowledge, ensuring physically plausible predictions and improved extrapolation beyond the training distribution.
        \item Neural Differential Equations (Neural ODEs/SDEs): Neural ODEs or SDEs embed neural networks into differential equations, allowing the modelling of dynamic processes through continuous-time representations. Such integration directly captures temporal dynamics, offering more flexibility and interpretability compared to classical discrete-time deep learning methods.
    \end{itemize}

Despite their promising advantages, hybrid and ensemble models have inherent challenges:
% Despite notable advancement in the scientific community, there is a conceptual gap, between the raw unstructured livestock data that can be captured and the strong theoretical knowledge we have of the complex underlying infectious mechanisms. This basically allows to ground the theoretical knowledge we have on a complex mechanisms to the context-specific observations, hence harness the best of both world. 

\textit{\textbf{Keywords:}} Ensemble learning, Physics-informed neural networks, Neural differential equations


Each ensemble strategy presents specific strengths and limitations, related to computational complexity, interpretability, and predictive power. 
research gaps:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Generalizability: The majority of integrated models focus on diseases like COVID-19, limiting applicability to other infectious diseases with indirect or complex transmission routes.
    \item Expansion beyond COVID-19 to other diseases with indirect transmission mechanisms.
    \item Data Limitations: Many studies depend on synthetic or limited real-world data, highlighting the need for richer, real-time data integration (e.g., satellite imagery, social media data). - we have gathered in this thesis a real-wolrd multi-modal dataset (...)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Maintainability}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item strongly coupled methods requires the builder to be deeply understand the problematic of domain in order to implement the models. (full stack vs frontend or backend). So retraining for example would require the whole system to be trained and in the long-term, it would also require sort of full-stack builders. 
        
        \item strongly coupled methods would still require a  certain quantity of data since in order for example for the deep learning model to fine-tune the mechanistic model (neural differential equations). Usually ensembled model (so more parameters) would require more dimensions in order to fit all the parameters (curse of dimensionality)
    \end{itemize}

% le domaine est très large, mais nous on va se focaliser uniquement sur le couplage deep et modèle méchaniste de façon générale.

\section{Thesis objective and outline}

\subsection{Exploring the complementarities between deep learning and mechanistic epidemiological models}

% in this subsection, I want to describe general objective of the thesis
% Notre hypothèse principale est que la meilleure voie scientifique pour répondre aux questions quantitatives actuelles en santé animale consiste à combiner plusieurs méthodes d’intelligence artificielle. Cela permettra de bénéficier tant de ses capacités de représentation, d’analyse, d’expressivité des connaissances multi-niveaux et inter-disciplinaires (épidémiologique, zootechnique, etc.) que de ses capacités prédictives (apprentissage profond, modèles mécanistes stochastiques) pour mieux coupler les observations (capteurs, éleveurs, vétérinaires) et des prédictions à différentes échelles temporelles (jours, semaines, mois).




On peut décomposer la solution (soutenue d'un point de vue véto également) aux problèmes complexes (l'étude et le contrôle des maladies infectieuse) qu'on essaie de résoudre: diagnostiquer , prognostiquer et recommender.

le diagnostique se fait à partir des observations terrains issue de capteurs (et les données non-structurées sont les plus fréquentes donc il faut du Deep Learning). Un bon prognostique se fait sur une connaissance theorique fondée (d'où les modèles mécanistes stochastique) mais pour avoir des recommendations pertinentes il faut l'encrée aux observations spécifiques terrains. 

mixture of expert (Moe) (il a d'autres noms surement) est un concept statisquement fondé selon lequel plusieurs experts spécialisés  sont mieux qu'un seul expert généraliste.

Parmi ceux qui ont fait le couplage ai et modèle epidemio certains l'ont fait stacking (different de bagging ou de boosting) et donc le ML/DL fait remplie le role de prognose sauf que le prognose qui est déja le role de modèle méca (c'est son expertise) et ils sont donc obligé d'avoir un meta-model pour pondérée les décisions. Encore une fois ce n'est pas aussi efficace selon le principe de mixture of experts, il y'a redondance des rôles. on va expliquer plutard en quoi ça pose problème (entrainement, scalabitité, générisité, transférabilité).

et puis il y a également ceux qui font du end-to-end structure où les structures sont fortement impriqués. (exemple le deep estime directement les paramètres du modèle méca (Neural differential equations), ou PINNs (physics-informed neural networks)). la construction nécessaire un plus haut skill gap, mais surtout  


J'ai lu la revue de littérature parrue dans nature en septembre 2024 (Nicolas parisey) parlant du couplage IA et model epidemiologique. Ce que nous proposons de nouveau par rapport à ce existe déjà ce n'est un juste un modèle couplé, mais une méthodologie qui couplage faible (à vérifier mais j'ai cru voir qu'ils sont tous en end-to-end training  ce qui a clairement c'est incovénient déjà le fait que la construction requiert plus grand skill gap comparé à un faible couplage et deuxièment la généricité et la modularité font qu'on peut seulement avoir comme une sorte de mixture of experts (réf à l'architecture de deepseek qui fait parlé) dont on mobilise le moins de ressource et maximise la précision du système ! mais en plus l'architecture peut est facilement transférable vers d'autres problèmes i.e entrainement rapide ....) qui incorpore une feature éssentielle qui ne peut peut pas avoir avoir une end-to-end structure (du fait que les structures sont durement imbriquées) et qu'on les autres n'ont pas n'ont plus creusés: (qu'est ce qui se passe si on a plusieurs modèles épidemiologiques tous valide (Tous les chemins mènent à Rome) mais qui explicite plus au moins différent aspects (stade clinique, mesures de controles, propagation de la maladie ...) car une fois de plus c'est mieux d'avoir plus petit modèles spécialisés (MoE) qu'un seul gros modèle entier plus complexe à calibré (démonstration avec le curse of dimentionality) on fait comment pour guarantir le bon choix du modèle qui aura la structure adéquate pour la situation pour permettre une prise de décision informé.


Precision agriculture has tools to enable the automation of real world observations through the use of sensors. In thesis (see chapter xx) I actually talk a bit my experience on setting-up and configuring sensors (hardware and communication). We need this contextual information however "Nos observations ne révèlent que la partie émergée d’un iceberg au comportement complexe et peu prévisible." (Yoan Bourhis, 2017). 

So how can sensor observations be used to study infectious disease and make informed decisions ?

Our main hypothesis is that a scientifically robust way to address contemporary quantitative questions in livestock farming and infectious diseases is to combine complementary artificial intelligence approaches—specifically deep learning and mechanistic epidemiological models. This allows us to leverage both the predictive capabilities of deep learning and the explicit, interpretable, and theoretical grounding provided by stochastic mechanistic epidemiological models.

In what ways can deep learning complement mechanistic models in epidemiology ?


(we have described our choice of deep learning for its processing perform on unstructured data which are common on sensors are are efficient data format particularly for preserving the )

On peut décomposer la solution (soutenue d'un point de vue véto également) aux problèmes complexes (l'étude et le contrôle des maladies infectieuse) qu'on essaie de résoudre: diagnostiquer , prognostiquer et recommender.


The Objectives of this methodological exploration are to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Show how from observations, deep learning could serve as the expert of diagnosis (short-term prediction) with their data-mining capabilities and how mechanistic models could serve as experts for prognose (long-term prediction) with their inherent theoretical knowledge. 
    \item Show how to distinguish and identify the best prognosis expert when they are multiple ones but we only have observations. 
    \item Show how to handle the uncertainties of the observations in the specification of the  diagnosis and prognosis experts.
    \item Elaborate a mixture-of-expertise diagnosis-to-prognosis methodology: grounding theoretical epidemiological knowledge to sensor observations for automated diagnosis and prognosis 
\end{itemize}

% These were the general objectives of this thesis at the start of the thesis. 
An originality of thesis is the problem we chose to tackle using our methodology. 

\textit{\textbf{Keywords:}} explore the complementarities, sketch a hybrid generic pipeline, get the best of both worlds, interpolation and extrapolation performance, automatic pattern recognition and biophysical rules based models, methodological synergy, integration of domain knowledge, applying domain knowledge to context-specific and unstructured empirical observations.

\subsection{Application to study Bovine Respiratory Diseases}
% In this subsection, I want to show that BRD are a good example for the application of our methodology

Bovine Respiratory Diseases (BRD) refer to a group of complex, multifactorial infectious disorders predominantly affecting young cattle in fattening farms. They are characterized by inflammation of the respiratory tract, causing symptoms such as cough, nasal discharge, fever, reduced feed intake, impaired growth, and occasionally, death. Although several pathogens (viruses, bacteria, mycoplasma) contribute to BRD, their clinical presentation is frequently non-specific, complicating accurate and timely diagnosis.

Diagnosing and managing BRD effectively remains notoriously challenging for several reasons:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Non-specific Clinical Signs: Clinical manifestations of BRD (e.g., cough, fever) are highly unspecific and overlap significantly with other diseases. Consequently, visual appraisal by farmers and veterinarians often results in misdiagnoses or delayed diagnoses, leading to suboptimal treatment strategies.
    \item Limitations of Biological Diagnostic Methods: Laboratory methods (e.g., Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), serology) provide increased specificity and accuracy compared to clinical appraisal alone. However, these tests are invasive, expensive, and time-consuming, delaying actionable results and increasing animal stress and discomfort. Moreover, logistical issues frequently limit their practicality, especially in large-scale operations.
    \item False Positives and Diagnostic Uncertainty: Due to the multifactorial nature of BRD (co-infections, pathogen interactions, host susceptibility variability), diagnostic and prognostic accuracy remain challenging. These difficulties result in inappropriate usage of antimicrobials, contributing to the rising threat of antimicrobial resistance and negatively impacting animal welfare.
\end{itemize}

(Complexity of BRD Etiology) BRD arises from complex interactions between intrinsic and extrinsic factors:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Pathogen Diversity and Interactions: Multiple pathogens (e.g., Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Bovine Respiratory Syncytial Virus, etc.) are frequently involved, potentially interacting in complex and poorly understood ways. Current veterinary research continues to explore these interactions to better characterize clinical markers useful for early detection, prognosis, and improved control measures (as exemplified in recent doctoral works, e.g., Maud’s research).
    \item Influence of Environmental and Management Practices: External factors such as farm management, biosecurity measures, herd density, transportation stress, and climatic conditions profoundly influence the occurrence and severity of BRD outbreaks. This intrinsic and extrinsic complexity significantly complicates disease modelling, prognosis, and control efforts.
\end{itemize}


(Socioeconomic Impact of BRD in Livestock Farming) Bovine Respiratory Diseases represent a major health and economic burden for farmers, veterinarians, and the broader livestock industry:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Economic Costs and Mortality Rates: BRD accounts for substantial economic losses in terms of reduced growth performance, increased mortality rates, and heightened veterinary and medicinal expenses. Particularly in French beef fattening farms, BRD is considered one of the most prevalent and economically significant animal health problems.
    \item Antimicrobial Usage and Ethical Concerns: Frequent misdiagnosis or delayed interventions lead to inappropriate use of antibiotics, fostering antimicrobial resistance. This concern raises ethical, public health, and animal welfare issues and highlights the urgent need for improved diagnostics and targeted therapeutic approaches.
\end{itemize}

(Existing Technological Approaches and Limitations) Recent research has applied sensor technologies (e.g., intra-ruminal temperature sensors, accelerometers, audio and video analytics) coupled with traditional machine learning and deep learning methods to improve BRD detection. Although promising, these data-driven approaches often:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Exhibit high false-positive rates due to limited specificity in clinical signs or ambiguous sensor outputs.
    \item Require substantial volumes of training data to achieve reliable performance, a constraint given practical difficulties in generating extensive labelled datasets.
    \item Struggle to predict disease progression or forecast epidemiological outcomes accurately over extended periods, thus limiting their use in proactive disease management and intervention strategies.
    \item Lack the capability to explore unobservable scenarios, such as hypothetical outbreaks or unrecorded infections, limiting their utility for scenario-based disease control planning.
\end{itemize}

There are also been mechanistic models developed before and throughout this thesis to model and study BRD (see Originality of this thesis). They have never applied to real-world observations. In this thesis, we employed these models to assess our methodology.

% Et du côté du modèle méca, Je peux peut-être en parler des modèles méca déjà construit (avant baptiste-sorin), et dire qu'ils ont servi pour avoir des insights de façon générale car calibrée à partir avec des valeurs moynnes provennat des experts mais ils peu adoptés pour par exemple construire un OAD qui pourrait être spécifiques aux données contextuelles.

% "notes: il faudrait relire un peu les articles de maud et sébastien assié pour renforcer cette sous-partie et surtout sa thèse qui prouvent que même du côté véto ça reste un problème scientifiquement intéressant qui n'est pas encore totalement résolu"

By bridging sophisticated deep learning feature extraction with robust, interpretable mechanistic models, this hybrid approach could significantly advance the ability to manage BRD effectively—improving animal health, welfare, farm economics, and sustainability and ecological issues.

\subsection{Originality of this thesis}


\paragraph{interdisciplinarity: synergy of diverse domain expertise }
% In this subsection, I want to explain the thesis CIFRE, with the mixture of domain expertise: epidemiological mechanistic modelling, statistical inference approaches, computer vision and deep learning, hardware and software engineering Mais également la collaboration avec les vétos. Préciser que c'est une thèse cifre (ce que peut apporter/ et les gains en retours pour adventiel: les côté applicatif, igepp (deep), Dynamo (mécaniste, inférence...). It is original to have as many different domain experts come together to work on one subject right ?

This thesis has a unique interdisciplinary structure facilitated by a CIFRE agreement. It integrates expertise and methodologies from diverse domains:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Adventiel: Providing strong expertise in software and hardware engineering for precision agriculture, particularly focusing on practical applications, technical robustness, and user-friendly decision support tools.
    \item BIOEPAR-dynamo: Offering significant theoretical and applied expertise in mechanistic epidemiological modelling and statistical inference methods, including parameter inference and calibration techniques, tailored specifically to livestock disease dynamics. Emulsion (generic simulation engine for epidemiological mechanistic models)
    \item IGEPP-demecologie: Contributing substantial expertise in statistical inference, deep learning, and computer vision methodologies.
    \item Collaborations established through multi-partner projects such as SEPTIME and MULTIPAST, involving key contributors (e.g., Baptiste-Sorin), enhance the thesis’s capacity to integrate different forms of scientific expertise.
\end{itemize}

Such interdisciplinary collaboration represents an innovative aspect, allowing the development of practical yet theoretically sound solutions tailored to real-world livestock epidemiology. Helps makes a practical, acceptable and well-perceived utility of developed tools and methods among livestock farmers.

\paragraph{Data collection: enriching empirical knowledge}

\begin{itemize}
    \item descrire ici la mise en place du protocol experimental avec la collecte de données pour répondre à des questions de biologiques sur le diagnostique et le prognostique de BRD (thèse maud) mais également des questions de méthodo modélisation (deep et méca)
    \item One major originality is the comprehensive and detailed collection of observational data from real livestock farms, specifically tailored to study Bovine Respiratory Diseases (BRD). The thesis provides explicit descriptions of this extensive dataset, composed of multi-modal sensor data, video recordings, and expert veterinary annotations
    \item The collected dataset enables exploration of both fundamental scientific questions and applied research inquiries, potentially leading to the development of innovative, practical decision support tools applicable directly within the livestock industry. (citer la thèse de maud, car elle utilise ces données afin d'accroître la connaissance sur l'identification de biomarqueurs des BRD) 
\end{itemize}

On peut décomposer la solution (soutenue d'un point de vue véto également) aux problèmes complexes (l'étude et le contrôle des maladies infectieuse) qu'on essaie de résoudre: diagnostiquer , prognostiquer et recommender.

This thesis proposes an original methodological framework that combines deep learning and mechanistic epidemiological modelling, with distinct contributions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Achieving robust diagnosis of BRD from unstructured and context-specific observational data, even in scenarios characterized by limited data availability.
    \item Grounding theoretical knowledge: Enhancing the identifiability and contextual specificity of stochastic mechanistic BRD models by integrating raw observational data collected directly from farms, improving the precision and relevance of epidemiological inference.
    \item Knowledge coherence: Establishing clear strategies for selecting and validating mechanistic models by aligning their theoretical structure explicitly with context-specific observational evidence. Compared to tightly coupled hybrid methods, our loosely coupled methodology significantly improves ease of interpretation, transparency, and flexibility.
    \item Deep mechanistic modelling: Developing a structured hybrid model that effectively grounds theoretical epidemiological insights of BRD within realistic, unstructured observations, forming the methodological baseline presented in the second paper.
    \item Proxy robustness: Enhancing the reliability and robustness of hybrid deep-mechanistic modelling by explicitly accounting for noisy observational inputs, thus mitigating the negative impacts of observational uncertainty.
    \item Modularity: Leveraging methodological modularity, this thesis highlights the ease with which domain experts (veterinarians, deep learning specialists, mechanistic modellers) can collaboratively develop, maintain, retrain, and adapt components independently. Modularity may also contribute to reduced data requirements and greater generalizability across scenarios, in contrast to strongly coupled methods, such as neural differential equations (NDEs) or Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).

\subsection{About the methodological approach}
 
Chapter 2: Foundational structures: independent expertise
Here, the thesis explores the performance of each foundational block independently. A deep learning model is trained and assessed on specific sensor observations to evaluate its ability to automate the process of unstructured data and generate high-level semantic feature descriptors of health of individual animals. A mechanistic model is fitted (parametrised) using veterinarians' observations of the animal, the purpose being to assess its explanatory and predictive performance on real-world observations. This chapter highlights the strengths and limitations of each approach, setting the stage for their integration. Both diagnosis and prognosis expertise are required to comprehend the context-specific dynamics and take relevant actions. 

Chapter 3: Structural synergism - identifying the relevant prognosis expert
Even though, it has been proven than multiple experts are better than one generalist, the is still gap when in the coupling frameworks as to how to coherently choose the right mechanistic model amongst multiple based solely on observations of an outbreak. We show how this features is important for taking better actions through evidence-based insights.  



% In the case of BRD which are multipathogenic, multiple pathogen-specific model were developed with various structures incoporating the various infectious and spread mechanimsms of BRD. In this chapter, we elaborate how to numerically distinguish and identify the mechanistic model (prognosis experts) that 
% the thesis elalorate how we proposed a method to numerically distinguish and identify
% identifying building blocks with complementary properties This chapter tackles the complexity of mechanistic modelling by comparing various mathematical structures and their suitability for different scenarios.


Chapter 4: A mixture of expertise: grounded mechanistic model for adaptive knowledge. In this chapter, we aimed sketching a hybrid pipeline where the long-term prognosis of the mechanistic model could be based on automated diagnosis of a deep learning network using an observation of a sensor. When chaining multiple experts, the bottleneck is handling the diffusion of the information, in livestock farming videos and audio observations are mostly noisy and can hinder on the diagnosis and prognosis of even expert veterinarians. In this chapter, we also introduce a way to handle the uncertainty of an unstructured observations in order to have a more reliable hybrid methodology. We measure the quality of observation through a measure of confidence in the diagnosis, this helps either filter-out highly doubtful diagnosis from noisy observations or make uncertainty-aware long-term prognosis. Both yielding interesting results.

This integration addresses the limitations of each individual approach, creating a comprehensive system capable of delivering actionable insights in complex, data-scarce environments.

General discussion: the final section synthesizes the findings across all chapters, critically evaluating the methodological approaches, their strengths and limitations, and the broader implications of the results. Recommendations for future research and applications are also discussed, highlighting the potential for scalability and interdisciplinary adaptation.
