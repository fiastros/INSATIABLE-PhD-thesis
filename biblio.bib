	abstract = {Background: Severity of lung lesions quantified by thoracic ultrasonography ({TUS}) at time of bronchopneumonia ({BP}) diagnosis predicted death among steers not treated for this condition. Further research is needed to confirm that lung lesions detected by {TUS} can be associated with negative outcomes in cattle with {BP} that subsequently were treated. Objective: To quantify the effects on relapse rate and average daily gain ({ADG}) of lung lesions detected by {TUS} at first {BP} diagnosis in feedlot cattle. Animals: Prospective cohort of mixed beef-breed steers (n = 93; 243 ± 36 kg) and heifers (n = 51; 227 ± 42 kg) with {BP} at 4 feedlots. Methods: Thoracic ultrasonography was performed by the same clinician and 16-second {TUS} videos were evaluated offline for maximal depth and area of lung consolidation, maximum number of comet tails, and maximal depth of pleural fluid. Individual {ADG} was calculated between 1 and 120 days after arrival. Effects of lesions on relapse rate and {ADG} were investigated using mixed regression models. Results: Maximal depth of lung consolidation was associated with a higher risk of relapse (odds ratio [{OR}], 1.337/cm; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 1.042-1.714) and lower {ADG} (− 34 g/cm; −64 to −4). Maximal area of lung consolidation also was associated with a higher relapse risk ({OR}, 1.052/cm2; 1.009-1.097) but not with {ADG}. Comet tails and pleural fluid were not associated with risk of relapse or {ADG}. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Quantifying maximal depth and area of lung consolidation by {TUS} at first {BP} diagnosis can provide useful prognostic information in feedlot cattle.},
