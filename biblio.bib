	abstract = {Background
              The analysis of COVID‐19 infection data through the eye of Physics‐inspired Artificial Intelligence leads to a clearer understanding of the infection dynamics and assists in predicting future evolution. The spreading of the pandemic during the first half of 2020 was curtailed to a larger or lesser extent through social distancing measures imposed by most countries. In the context of the standard Susceptible‐Infected‐Recovered (SIR) model, changes in social distancing enter through time‐dependent infection rates.
            
            
              Methods
              In this work we use machine learning and the infection dynamical equations of SIR to extract from the infection data the degree of social distancing and, through it, assess the effectiveness of the imposed measures.
            
            
              Results
              Quantitative machine learning analysis is applied to eight countries with infection data from the first viral wave. We find as two extremes Greece and USA where the measures were successful and unsuccessful, respectively, in limiting spreading. This physics‐based neural network approach is employed to the second wave of the infection, and by training the network with the new data, we extract the time‐dependent infection rate and make short‐term predictions with a week‐long or even longer horizon. This algorithmic approach is applied to all eight countries with good short‐term results. The data for Greece is analyzed in more detail from August to December 2020.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The model captures the essential spreading dynamics and gives useful projections for the spreading, both in the short‐term but also for a more intermediate horizon, based on specific social distancing measures that are extracted directly from the data.

              Author summary:
              This work combines machine learning techniques with mathematical models known in epidemiology, enabling the extraction of COVID‐19 infection information in different countries. This approach controls the data‐driven information and shows how various measures and practices in each country are directly reflected in the infection data. The use of machine learning, especially neural networks, allows the extraction of the time‐dependent infection rate that drives the evolution of the pandemic in each country. Knowledge of the time‐dependent infection rate allows short‐term predictions with a week‐long or even longer horizon.},

	abstract = {Stochastic modeling predicts various outcomes from stochasticity in the data, parameters and dynamical system. Stochastic models are deemed more appropriate than deterministic models accounting in terms of essential and practical information about a system. The objective of the current investigation is to address the issue above through the development of a novel deep neural network referred to as a stochastic epidemiology-informed neural network. This network learns knowledge about the parameters and dynamics of a stochastic epidemic vaccine model. Our analysis centers on examining the nonlinear incidence rate of the model from the perspective of the combined effects of vaccination and stochasticity. Based on empirical evidence, stochastic models offer a more comprehensive understanding than deterministic models, mainly when we use error metrics. The findings of our study indicate that a decrease in randomness and an increase in vaccination rates are associated with a better prediction of nonlinear incidence rates. Adopting a nonlinear incidence rate enables a more comprehensive representation of the complexities of transmitting diseases. The computational analysis of the proposed method, focusing on sensitivity analysis and overfitting analysis, shows that the proposed method is efficient. Our research aims to guide policymakers on the effects of stochasticity in epidemic models, thereby aiding the development of effective vaccination and mitigation policies. Several case studies have been conducted on nonlinear incidence rates using data from Tennessee, USA.},

Although neural forecasting models have been successful in multiple tasks, predictions well-correlated with epidemic trends and long-term predictions remain open challenges. Epidemiological ODE models contain mechanisms that can guide us in these two tasks; however, they have limited capability of ingesting data sources and modeling composite signals. Thus, we propose to leverage work in physics-informed neural networks to learn latent epidemic dynamics and transfer relevant knowledge to another neural network which ingests multiple data sources and has more appropriate inductive bias. In contrast with previous work, we do not assume the observability of complete dynamics and do not need to numerically solve the ODE equations during training. Our thorough experiments on all US states and HHS regions for COVID-19 and influenza forecasting showcase the clear benefits of our approach in both short-term and long-term forecasting as well as in learning the mechanistic dynamics over other non-trivial alternatives.},

Specifically, we build on the application of PINNs to SIR compartmental models and expand it a scaffolded family of mathematical models describing various infectious diseases. We show how the neural networks are capable of learning how diseases spread, forecasting their progression, and finding their unique parameters (e.g. death rate). To demonstrate the robustness and efficacy of DINNs, we apply the approach to eleven highly infectious diseases that have been modeled in increasing levels of complexity. Our computational experiments suggest that DINNs is a reliable candidate for effectively learn about the dynamics of spread and forecast its progression into the future from available real-world data.},

	abstract = {When investigating epidemic dynamics through differential models, the parameters needed to understand the phenomenon and to simulate forecast scenarios require a delicate calibration phase, often made even more challenging by the scarcity and uncertainty of the observed data reported by official sources. In this context, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), by embedding the knowledge of the differential model that governs the physical phenomenon in the learning process, can effectively address the inverse and forward problem of data-driven learning and solving the corresponding epidemic problem. In many circumstances, however, the spatial propagation of an infectious disease is characterized by movements of individuals at different scales governed by multiscale partial differential equations. This reflects the heterogeneity of a region or territory in relation to the dynamics within cities and in neighboring zones. In presence of multiple scales, a direct application of PINNs generally leads to poor results due to the multiscale nature of the differential model in the loss function of the neural network. To allow the neural network to operate uniformly with respect to the small scales, it is desirable that the neural network satisfies an Asymptotic-Preservation (AP) property in the learning process. To this end, we consider a new class of AP neural networks for multiscale hyperbolic transport models of epidemic spread that, thanks to an appropriate AP formulation of the loss function, is capable of working uniformly at the different scales of the system. A series of numerical tests for different epidemic scenarios confirms the validity of the proposed approach, highlighting the importance of the AP property in the neural network when dealing with multiscale problems especially in presence of sparse and partially observed systems.},

	abstract = {Correlated multivariate time series prediction is an effective tool for discovering the chang rules of temporal data, but it is challenging to find these rules. Recently, deep learning methods have made it possible to predict high-dimensional and complex multivariate time series data. However, these methods cannot capture or predict potential mutation signals of time series, leading to a lag in data prediction trends and large errors. Moreover, it is difficult to capture dependencies of the data, especially when the data is sparse and the time intervals are large. In this paper, we proposed a prediction approach that leverages both propagation dynamics and deep learning, called Rolling Iterative Prediction (RIP). In RIP method, the Time-Delay Moving Average (TDMA) is used to carry out maximum likelihood reduction on the raw data, and the propagation dynamics model is applied to obtain the potential propagation parameters data, and dynamic properties of the correlated multivariate time series are clearly established. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is applied to capture the time dependencies of data, and the medium and long-term Rolling Iterative Prediction method is established by alternately estimating parameters and predicting time series. Experiments are performed on the data of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China, France, and South Korea. Experimental results show that the real distribution of the epidemic data is well restored, the prediction accuracy is better than baseline methods.},

	abstract = {Infectious disease risk prediction plays a vital role in disease control and prevention. Recent studies in machine learning have attempted to incorporate epidemiological knowledge into the learning process to enhance the accuracy and informativeness of prediction results for decision-making. However, these methods commonly involve single-patch mechanistic models, overlooking the disease spread across multiple locations caused by human mobility. Additionally, these methods often require extra information beyond the infection data, which is typically unavailable in reality. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel epidemiology-aware deep learning framework that integrates a fundamental epidemic component, the next-generation matrix (NGM), into the deep architecture and objective function. This integration enables the inclusion of both mechanistic models and human mobility in the learning process to characterize within- and cross-location disease transmission. From this framework, two novel methods, Epi-CNNRNN-Res and Epi-Cola-GNN, are further developed to predict epidemics, with experimental results validating their effectiveness.},

In this study, we propose a novel hybrid model called MepoGNN for multi-step multi-region epidemic forecasting by incorporating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and graph learning mechanisms into Metapopulation SIR model. Our model can not only predict the number of conﬁrmed cases but also explicitly learn the epidemiological parameters and the underlying epidemic propagation graph from heterogeneous data in an end-toend manner. Experiment results demonstrate our model outperforms the existing mechanistic models and deep learning models by a large margin. Furthermore, the analysis on the learned parameters demonstrates the high reliability and interpretability of our model and helps better understanding of epidemic spread.

It uses a graph attention network to capture spatio-temporal trends of disease dynamics and to predict the number of cases for a fixed number of days into the future. We also designed a dynamics-based loss term for enhancing long-term predictions. STAN was tested using both real-world patient claims data and COVID-19 statistics over time across US counties.STAN outperforms traditional epidemiological models such as susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR), susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR), and deep learning models on both long-term and short-term predictions, achieving up to 87\% reduction in mean squared error compared to the best baseline prediction model.By combining information from real-world claims data and disease case counts data, STAN can better predict disease status and medical resource utilization.},

The classical infectious disease model SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) is a compact yet simplistic temporal model. The data-driven machine learning models such as RNN (recurrent neural networks) can suffer in case of limited time series data such as COVID-19. In this paper, we combine SEIR and RNN on a graph structure to develop a hybrid spatio-temporal model to achieve both accuracy and efficiency in training and forecasting. We introduce two features on the graph structure: node feature (local temporal infection trend) and edge feature (geographic neighbor effect). For node feature, we derive a discrete recursion (called I-equation) from SEIR so that gradient descend method applies readily to its optimization. For edge feature, we design an RNN model to capture the neighboring effect and regularize the landscape of loss function so that local minima are effective and robust for prediction. The resulting hybrid model (called IeRNN) improves the prediction accuracy on state-level COVID-19 new case data from the US, out-performing standard temporal models (RNN, SEIR, and ARIMA) in 1-day and 7-day ahead forecasting. Our model accommodates various degrees of reopening and provides potential outcomes for policymakers.},

	abstract = {The global pandemic, COVID-19, is an acute respiratory infectious disease caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus. Building the online epidemic supervising system to provide COVID-19 dynamic prediction and analysis has attracted the attention of the industry and applications community. In previous studies, the compartmental models and deep neural networks (DNNs) played important roles in predicting and analyzing the dynamics of the pandemic. Nevertheless, the compartmental model has limited ability to fit historical data and thus leads to unsatisfactory prediction accuracy due to the difficulty in parameter estimation. For DNNs, the lack of interpretability makes it difficult to explain the prediction results; thus, it cannot provide an in-depth understanding of the transmission mechanism of the pandemic. We propose a fusion model to leverage the merits of both models and resolve their shortcomings. The fusion model extracts epidemic-related knowledge from the state-of-the-art SEIDR compartmental model to guide the training of the GRU model, which can preserve the interpretability and achieve a good performance in predicting epidemic dynamics. This model can help to enhance the online epidemic supervising system by providing more accurate prediction results and deeper analysis. Our extensive experiments across multiple epidemic datasets from six European countries demonstrate that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines in predicting the active confirmed cases. More importantly, by analyzing the effective reproductive number, our method can reveal the risk of the second wave of the epidemic in Europe and justify the importance of social distancing to control the outbreak of the epidemic.},

With the advent of reliable spatiotemporal data, graph neural network models have been able to successfully model the inter-relation between the cross-region signals to produce quality forecasts, but like most deep-learning models they do not explicitly incorporate the underlying causal mechanisms. In this work, we employ a causal mechanistic model to guide the learning of the graph embeddings and propose a novel learning framework -- Causal-based Graph Neural Network (CausalGNN) that learns spatiotemporal embedding in a latent space where graph input features and epidemiological context are combined via a mutually learning mechanism using graph-based non-linear transformations. We design an attention-based dynamic GNN module to capture spatial and temporal disease dynamics. A causal module is added to the framework to provide epidemiological context for node embedding via ordinary differential equations. Extensive experiments on forecasting daily new cases of COVID-19 at global, US state, and US county levels show that the proposed method outperforms a broad range of baselines. The learned model which incorporates epidemiological context organizes the embedding in an efficient way by keeping the parameter size small leading to robust and accurate forecasting performance across various datasets.},

As reported by the World Health Organization, there are currently more than 100 million infectious cases with an average mortality rate of about five percent all over the world. To avoid serious consequences on people's lives and the economy, policies and actions need to be suitably made in time. To do that, the authorities need to know the future trend in the development process of this pandemic. This is the reason why forecasting models play an important role in controlling the pandemic situation. However, the behavior of this pandemic is extremely complicated and difficult to be analyzed, so that an effective model is not only considered on accurate forecasting results but also the explainable capability for human experts to take action pro-actively. With the recent advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, the emerging Deep Learning (DL) models have been proving highly effective when forecasting this pandemic future from the huge historical data. However, the main weakness of DL models is lacking the explanation capabilities. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel combination of the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Deceased (SIRD) compartmental model and Variational Autoencoder (VAE) neural network known as BeCaked. With pandemic data provided by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering, our model achieves 0.98 [Formula: see text] and 0.012 MAPE at world level with 31-step forecast and up to 0.99 [Formula: see text] and 0.0026 MAPE at country level with 15-step forecast on predicting daily infectious cases. Not only enjoying high accuracy, but BeCaked also offers useful justifications for its results based on the parameters of the SIRD model. Therefore, BeCaked can be used as a reference for authorities or medical experts to make on time right decisions.},

First, we leverage mixture models to develop an accurate, comprehensive, yet impractical simulation system. Next, we use simulated observation sequences to query the simulation system to retrieve simulated projection sequences as knowledge. Then, with the obtained query data, sequence mixup is proposed to improve query efficiency, increase knowledge diversity, and boost distillation model accuracy. Finally, we train a student deep neural network with the retrieved and mixed observation-projection sequences for practical use. The case study on COVID-19 justifies that our approach accurately projects infections with much lower computation cost when observation data are limited.},

            Forecasting the evolution of contagion dynamics is still an open problem to which mechanistic models only offer a partial answer. To remain mathematically or computationally tractable, these models must rely on simplifying assumptions, thereby limiting the quantitative accuracy of their predictions and the complexity of the dynamics they can model. Here, we propose a complementary approach based on deep learning where effective local mechanisms governing a dynamic on a network are learned from time series data. Our graph neural network architecture makes very few assumptions about the dynamics, and we demonstrate its accuracy using different contagion dynamics of increasing complexity. By allowing simulations on arbitrary network structures, our approach makes it possible to explore the properties of the learned dynamics beyond the training data. Finally, we illustrate the applicability of our approach using real data of the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain. Our results demonstrate how deep learning offers a new and complementary perspective to build effective models of contagion dynamics on networks.},

In this study, we address the modeling of COVID-19 spread across space and time, which facilitates understanding of the pandemic. We propose a hybrid data-driven learning approach to capture the mobility-related spreading mechanism of infectious diseases, utilizing multi-sourced mobility and attributed data. This study develops a visual analytic approach that identifies and depicts the strength of the transmission pathways of COVID-19 between areal units by integrating data-driven deep learning and compartmental epidemic models, thereby engaging stakeholders (e.g., public health officials, managers from transportation agencies) to make informed intervention decisions and enable public messaging. A case study in the state of Colorado, USA was performed to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed transmission modeling approach in understanding the spatio-temporal spread of COVID-19 at the neighborhood level. Transmission path maps are presented and analyzed, demonstrating their utility in evaluating the effects of mitigation measures. In addition, integrated embeddings also support daily prediction of infected cases and role analysis of each area unit during the transmission of the virus.},

In the latter case, we take advantage of the natural adjoint-like properties of generative models and the ability to simulate forwards and backwards in time. GANs have received much attention recently, after achieving excellent results for their generation of realistic-looking images. We wish to explore how this property translates to new applications in computational modelling and to exploit the adjoint-like properties for efficient data assimilation. We apply these methods to a compartmental model in epidemiology that is able to model space and time variations, and that mimics the spread of COVID-19 in an idealised town. To do this, the GAN is set within a reduced-order model, which uses a low-dimensional space for the spatial distribution of the simulation states. Then the GAN learns the evolution of the low-dimensional states over time. The results show that the proposed methods can accurately predict the evolution of the high-fidelity numerical simulation, and can efficiently assimilate observed data and determine the corresponding model parameters.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a parameter identification methodology of the SIRD model, an extension of the classical SIR model, that considers the deceased as a separate category. In addition, our model includes one parameter which is the ratio between the real total number of infected and the number of infected that were documented in the official statistics. Due to many factors, like governmental decisions, several variants circulating, opening and closing of schools, the typical assumption that the parameters of the model stay constant for long periods of time is not realistic. Thus our objective is to create a method which works for short periods of time. In this scope, we approach the estimation relying on the previous 7 days of data and then use the identified parameters to make predictions. To perform the estimation of the parameters we propose the average of an ensemble of neural networks. Each neural network is constructed based on a database built by solving the SIRD for 7 days, with random parameters. In this way, the networks learn the parameters from the solution of the SIRD model. Lastly we use the ensemble to get estimates of the parameters from the real data of Covid19 in Romania and then we illustrate the predictions for different periods of time, from 10 up to 45 days, for the number of deaths. The main goal was to apply this approach on the analysis of COVID-19 evolution in Romania, but this was also exemplified on other countries like Hungary, Czech Republic and Poland with similar results. The results are backed by a theorem which guarantees that we can recover the parameters of the model from the reported data. We believe this methodology can be used as a general tool for dealing with short term predictions of infectious diseases or in other compartmental models.},

This issue could severely impact the accuracy of expected active case, thereby affecting future government intervention protection policies etc. In this paper, a new method to accurately predict active cases considering anomalies is presented. Firstly, an autoencoder is used to detect the vaccine anomalies, Then, in order to impute missing values in the complete African vaccination data a small-scale k nearest neighbor (ssKNN) with upper and lower bounds is developed. As an extension of K-nearest neighbor interpolation, ssKNN could guarantee the interpolation quality and efficiency by limiting the filling range. To be specific, the upper and lower bounds of missing values are found based on the proposed method, and then the missing values could be filled according to the upper and lower bounds as well as the Euclidean distance. Then, the transmission rate β is estimated using long short-term memory (LSTM), which is an essential parameter in a classical mechanistic model for projecting the number of future active cases. Finally, the effectiveness of proposed method is verified on dataset of 15 worst-affected countries by COVID-19 epidemic in Africa demonstrating its efficacy in prediction of active cases of COVID-19 with vaccine anomalies.},

	abstract = {After the new Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in the end of January 2020 in Germany, a large number of individuals suffered from severe symptoms and eventually needed intensive care in hospitals. Due to the rapid spread of the disease, the number of deceased individuals increased as well, which is a motivation to prevent as many new infections as possible. Therefore, the knowledge about the current evolution of the virus spread is crucial to predict its future behavior and to react with suitable interventions. In this paper, the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany is forecasted by a network-based inference method, in which the interactions of individuals are taken into account using a contact matrix. Then the results are compared to the predictions without considering a contact matrix as well as to the logistic regression, which shows the advantage of incorporating the contact matrix. Furthermore, the basic reproduction number of the pandemic in Germany using a neural network approach is estimated and used for further predictions of the evolution of COVID-19 in Germany. In order to mathematically model the different compartments of the population in the considered regions, the classical SIR model is employed. In this work, we deploy the LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) for the unknown parameter estimation. Furthermore, we calculate and illustrate the MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) of the estimations to show the accuracy of the predictions. The results include model parameter estimation and model validation, as well as the outbreak forecasting using network-informed algorithms. Our findings show that the network-inference based approach outperforms the logistic regression as well as the neural network approach and the SIR model calibration without a contact network. Furthermore according to the results, the network-inference based approach is particularly suitable for short- to mid-term predictions, even when there is not much information about the new disease. Moreover, the predictions based on the estimation of the reproduction number in Germany can yield more reliable results with increasing the availability of data, but could not outperform the network-inference based algorithm.},

To deal with non-stationary patterns and multiple waves of an epidemic, we develop a hybrid model encompassing epidemic modeling, particle swarm optimization, and deep learning. The model mainly caters to three objectives for better prediction: 1. Periodic estimation of the model parameters. 2. Incorporating impact of all the aspects using data fitting and parameter optimization 3. Deep learning based prediction of the model parameters. In our model, we use a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead (SIRD) epidemic modeling, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for model parameter optimization, and stacked-LSTM for forecasting the model parameters. Initial or one time estimation of model parameters is not able to model multiple waves of an epidemic. So, we estimate the model parameters periodically (weekly). We use PSO to identify the optimum values of the model parameters. We next train the stacked-LSTM on the optimized parameters, and perform forecasting of the model parameters for upcoming four weeks. Further, we fed the LSTM forecasted parameters into the SIRD model to forecast the number of COVID-19 cases. We evaluate the model for highly affected three countries namely; the USA, India, and the UK. The proposed hybrid model is able to deal with multiple waves, and has outperformed existing methods on all the three datasets.},

Additionally, we applied artificial intelligence utilizing the deep neural network machine learning (ML) technique. On the initial spread data for Saudi Arabia that were available up to June 25$^{\textrm{th}}$, 2021, this improved SEIR model was used. The study shows possible infection to around 3.1 million persons without lockdown in Saudi Arabia at the peak of spread, which lasts for about 3 months beginning from the lockdown date (March 21$^{\textrm{st}}$). On the other hand, the Kingdom's current partial lockdown policy was estimated to cut the estimated number of infections to 0.5 million over nine months. The data shows that stricter lockdowns may successfully flatten the COVID-19 graph curve in Saudi Arabia.

The existing dynamic models do not consider the synergistic effects of population migration factors and changes in transmission rates on diseases. Therefore, based on the SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) model, the time-dependent M-SIR (Migration-Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) model was proposed by introducing the population migration (Migration) factor. Meanwhile, introducing the machine learning LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine) method to track the infection rate and recovery rate, and explored the impact of cross-regional population movement and prevention and control measures on the development of the epidemic. Take the new crown epidemic as an example, firstly, the data of population migration and epidemic spread were statistically analyzed to monitor the relationship between population mobility and epidemic development. Then, the m-sir model is used to predict the infected cases and removed cases in Beijing and Shanghai. Through comparative analysis with the SIR model, the prediction accuracy of the model has been greatly improved. At the same time, the development trend of the epidemic situation in related cities before and after control is explored, which can provide some theoretical support for future epidemic prediction and control decisions.},

	abstract = {As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage the world, it is critical to assess the COVID-19 risk timely on multi-scale. To implement it and evaluate the public health policies, we develop a machine learning assisted framework to predict epidemic dynamics from the reported infection data. It contains a county-level spatio-temporal epidemiological model, which combines spatial cellular automata (CA) with time sensitive-undiagnosed-infected-removed (SUIR) model, and is compatible with the existing risk prediction models. The CA-SUIR model shows the multi-scale risk to the public and reveals the transmission modes of coronavirus in different scenarios. Through transfer learning, this new toolbox is used to predict the prevalence of multi-scale COVID-19 in all 412 counties in Germany. A t-day-ahead risk forecast as well as assessment of the non-pharmaceutical intervention policies is presented. We analyzed the situation at Christmas of 2020, and found that the most serious death toll could be 34.5. However, effective policy could control it below 21thousand, which provides a quantitative basis for evaluating the public policies implemented by the government. Such intervening evaluation process would help to improve public health policies and restart the economy appropriately in pandemics.},

The rapid spread of the coronavirus has brought great challenges to the global community. In this paper, the effectiveness of the following three epidemic prevention measures, including makeshift hospitals, closed cities, and wearing masks, is evaluated by establishing relevant mathematical models and applying the circulating neural network. For the scenes of closed cities and makeshift hospitals, the improved model of SEIR eight cabins is established in this paper, and the parameters are updated in real-time by Long Short-Term Memory. The following results are obtained: the closed city measures greatly reduce the probability of the transfer of susceptible persons to latent ones, and the epidemic is effectively controlled. Regarding the issue of wearing masks, this paper established the MUEIR model and solved with a particle swarm optimization algorithm. It is concluded that the number of infected people decreased by 42\% compared with the natural situation, indicating the effectiveness of wearing masks. In conclusion, the effectiveness of the above three epidemic prevention measures is scientifically evaluated, and artificial intelligence technology is combined to achieve intelligent dynamic prediction of the epidemic development trend.},

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly used to estimate the parameters of system dynamics models.

The incorporation of AI tools into system dynamics presents opportunities for expanding on current decision-making methods. As systems become complex, the need to incorporate evidence-based data-driven methods increases. By integrating system dynamics tools and facilitating AI and system dynamics simulation in an integrated environment, model parameters can be estimated with the latest data, and the integrity of the model can be retained effectively.

This paper presents a general methodology to incorporate regression AI into system dynamics models for simulation and analysis.

Therefore, this study introduces an integrated model for predicting the number of confirmed cases from the perspective of Bangladesh. Moreover, the number of quarantined patients and the change in basic reproduction rate (the R0-value) can also be evaluated using this model. This integrated model combines the SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Removed) epidemiological model and neural networks. The model was trained using available data from 250 days. The accuracy of the prediction of confirmed cases is almost between 90\% and 99\%. The performance of this integrated model was evaluated by showing the difference in accuracy between the integrated model and the general SEIR model. The result shows that the integrated model is more accurate than the general SEIR model while predicting the number of confirmed cases in Bangladesh.},

This is evidenced by the proliferation of monitoring, data collection, analysis, and prediction systems aimed at controlling the pandemic. This article proposes a hybrid model that combines the dynamics of epidemiological processes with the predictive capabilities of artificial neural networks to go beyond the prediction of the first ones. In addition, the system allows for the introduction of additional information through an expert system, thus allowing the incorporation of additional hypotheses on the adoption of containment measures.

	abstract = {COVID-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has a case-fatality rate of 2–3\%, with higher rates among elderly patients and patients with comorbidities. Radiologically, COVID-19 is characterised by multifocal ground-glass opacities, even for patients with mild disease. Clinically, patients with COVID-19 present respiratory symptoms, which are very similar to other respiratory virus infections. Our knowledge regarding the SARS-CoV-2 virus is still very limited. These facts make it vitally important to establish mechanisms that allow to model and predict the evolution of the virus and to analyze the spread of cases under different circumstances. The objective of this article is to present a model developed for the evolution of COVID in the city of Manizales, capital of the Department of Caldas, Colombia, focusing on the methodology used to allow its application to other cases, as well as on the monitoring tools developed for this purpose. This methodology is based on a hybrid model which combines the population dynamics of the SIR model of differential equations with extrapolations based on recurrent neural networks. This combination provides self-explanatory results in terms of a coefficient that fluctuates with the restraint measures, which may be further refined by expert rules that capture the expected changes in such measures.},

In particular, in a severe pandemic situation like COVID-19, human movements among different regions are taken as the most important point for understanding and forecasting the epidemic spread in a country. Thus, in this study, we collect big human GPS trajectory data covering the total 47 prefectures of Japan and model the daily human movements between each pair of prefectures with time-series Origin-Destination (OD) matrix. Then, given the historical observations from past days, we predict the countrywide OD matrices for the future one or more weeks by proposing a novel deep learning model called Origin-Destination Convolutional Recurrent Network (ODCRN). It integrates the recurrent and 2-dimensional graph convolutional components to deal with the highly complex spatiotemporal dependencies in sequential OD matrices. Experiment results over the entire COVID-19 period demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methodology over existing OD prediction models. Last, we apply the predicted countrywide OD matrices to the SEIR model, one of the most classic and widely used epidemic simulation model, to forecast the COVID-19 infection numbers for the entire Japan. The simulation results also demonstrate the high reliability and applicability of our countrywide OD prediction model for a pandemic scenario like COVID-19.},

	abstract = {COVID-19 is one of the biggest challenges that human beings have faced recently. Many researchers have proposed different prediction methods for establishing a virus transmission model and predicting the trend of COVID-19. Among them, the methods based on artificial intelligence are currently the most interesting and widely used. However, only using artificial intelligence methods for prediction cannot capture the time change pattern of the transmission of infectious diseases. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a COVID-19 prediction model based on time-dependent SIRVD by using deep learning. This model combines deep learning technology with the mathematical model of infectious diseases, and forecasts the parameters in the mathematical model of infectious diseases by fusing deep learning models such as LSTM and other time prediction methods. In the current situation of mass vaccination, we analyzed COVID-19 data from January 15, 2021, to May 27, 2021 in seven countries – India, Argentina, Brazil, South Korea, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy. The experimental results show that the prediction model not only has a 50\% improvement in single-day predictions compared to pure deep learning methods, but also can be adapted to short- and medium-term predictions, which makes the overall prediction more interpretable and robust.},

It is urgent to conduct prediction research on the development and spread of the epidemic. In this article, a hybrid artificial-intelligence (AI) model is proposed for COVID-19 prediction. First, as traditional epidemic models treat all individuals with coronavirus as having the same infection rate, an improved susceptible–infected (ISI) model is proposed to estimate the variety of the infection rates for analyzing the transmission laws and development trend. Second, considering the effects of prevention and control measures and the increase of the public’s prevention awareness, the natural language processing (NLP) module and the long short-term memory (LSTM) network are embedded into the ISI model to build the hybrid AI model for COVID-19 prediction. The experimental results on the epidemic data of several typical provinces and cities in China show that individuals with coronavirus have a higher infection rate within the third to eighth days after they were infected, which is more in line with the actual transmission laws of the epidemic. Moreover, compared with the traditional epidemic models, the proposed hybrid AI model can significantly reduce the errors of the prediction results and obtain the mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) with 0.52\%, 0.38\%, 0.05\%, and 0.86\% for the next six days in Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai, and countrywide, respectively.},

	abstract = {Predictions of COVID-19 case growth and mortality are critical to the decisions of political leaders, businesses, and individuals grappling with the pandemic. This predictive task is challenging due to the novelty of the virus, limited data, and dynamic political and societal responses. We embed a Bayesian time series model and a random forest algorithm within an epidemiological compartmental model for empirically grounded COVID-19 predictions. The Bayesian case model fits a location-specific curve to the velocity (first derivative) of the log transformed cumulative case count, borrowing strength across geographic locations and incorporating prior information to obtain a posterior distribution for case trajectories. The compartmental model uses this distribution and predicts deaths using a random forest algorithm trained on COVID-19 data and population-level characteristics, yielding daily projections and interval estimates for cases and deaths in U.S. states. We evaluated the model by training it on progressively longer periods of the pandemic and computing its predictive accuracy over 21-day forecasts. The substantial variation in predicted trajectories and associated uncertainty between states is illustrated by comparing three unique locations: New York, Colorado, and West Virginia. The sophistication and accuracy of this COVID-19 model offer reliable predictions and uncertainty estimates for the current trajectory of the pandemic in the U.S. and provide a platform for future predictions as shifting political and societal responses alter its course.},

	abstract = {Understanding the joint impact of vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19 development is important for making public health decisions that control the pandemic. Recently, we created a method in forecasting the daily number of confirmed cases of infectious diseases by combining a mechanistic ordinary differential equation (ODE) model for infectious classes and a generalized boosting machine learning model (GBM) for predicting how public health policies and mobility data affect the transmission rate in the ODE model (Wang et al. in Bull Math Biol 84:57, 2022). In this paper, we extend the method to the post-vaccination period, accordingly obtain a retrospective forecast of COVID-19 daily confirmed cases in the US, and identify the relative influence of the policies used as the predictor variables. In particular, our ODE model contains both partially and fully vaccinated compartments and accounts for the breakthrough cases, that is, vaccinated individuals can still get infected. Our results indicate that the inclusion of data on non-pharmaceutical interventions can significantly improve the accuracy of the predictions. With the use of policy data, the model predicts the number of daily infected cases up to 35 days in the future, with an average mean absolute percentage error of \$\$20.15{\textbackslash}\%\$\$, which is further improved to \$\$14.88{\textbackslash}\%\$\$if combined with human mobility data. Moreover, the most influential predictor variables are the policies of restrictions on gatherings, testing and school closing. The modeling approach used in this work can help policymakers design control measures as variant strains threaten public health in the future.},

	abstract = {Accurate prediction of the number of daily or weekly confirmed cases of COVID-19 is critical to the control of the pandemic. Existing mechanistic models nicely capture the disease dynamics. However, to forecast the future, they require the transmission rate to be known, limiting their prediction power. Typically, a hypothesis is made on the form of the transmission rate with respect to time. Yet the real form is too complex to be mechanistically modeled due to the unknown dynamics of many influential factors. We tackle this problem by using a hypothesis-free machine-learning algorithm to estimate the transmission rate from data on non-pharmaceutical policies, and in turn forecast the confirmed cases using a mechanistic disease model. More specifically, we build a hybrid model consisting of a mechanistic ordinary differential equation (ODE) model and a gradient boosting model (GBM). To calibrate the parameters, we develop an “inverse method” that obtains the transmission rate inversely from the other variables in the ODE model and then feed it into the GBM to connect with the policy data. The resulting model forecasted the number of daily confirmed cases up to 35 days in the future in the USA with an averaged mean absolute percentage error of 27\%. It can identify the most informative predictive variables, which can be helpful in designing improved forecasters as well as informing policymakers.},

	abstract = {Background: Compartmental models dominate epidemic modeling. Transmission parameters between compartments are typically estimated through stochastic parameterization processes that depends on detailed statistics of transmission characteristics, which are economically and resource-wise expensive to collect.
Objective: We aim to apply deep learning techniques as a lower data dependency alternative to estimate transmission parameters of a customized compartmental model, for the purpose of simulating the dynamics of the US coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic and projecting its further development.
Methods: We constructed a compartmental model and developed a multistep deep learning methodology to estimate the model’s transmission parameters. We then fed the estimated transmission parameters to the model to predict development of the US COVID-19 epidemic for 35 and 42 days. Epidemics are considered suppressed when the basic reproduction number (R0) is less than 1.
Results: The deep learning–enhanced compartmental model predicts that R0 will fall to \&lt;1 around August 17-19, 2020, at which point the epidemic will effectively start to die out, and that the US “infected” population will peak around August 16-18, 2020, at 3,228,574 to 3,308,911 individual cases. The model also predicted that the number of accumulative confirmed cases will cross the 5 million mark around August 7, 2020.
Conclusions: Current compartmental models require stochastic parameterization to estimate the transmission parameters. These models’ effectiveness depends upon detailed statistics on transmission characteristics. As an alternative, deep learning techniques are effective in estimating these stochastic parameters with greatly reduced dependency on data particularity.},

	abstract = {The coronavirus (COVID-19) has mutated into several variants, and evidence says that new variants are more transmissible than existing variants. Even with full-scale vaccination efforts, the theoretical threshold for eradicating COVID-19 appears out of reach. This article proposes an artificial intelligence(AI) based intelligent prediction model called Deep-SIQRV(Susceptible–Infected–Quarantined–Recovered-Vaccinated) to simulate the spreading of COVID-19. While many models assume that vaccination provides lifetime protection, we focus on the impact of waning immunity caused by the conversion of vaccinated individuals back to susceptible ones. Unlike existing models, which assume that all coronavirus-infected individuals have the same infection rate, the proposed model considers the various infection rates to analyze transmission laws and trends. Next, we consider the influence of prevention and control strategies, such as media marketing and law enforcement, on the spread of the epidemic. We employed the PAN-LDA model to extract features from COVID-19-related discussions on social media and online news articles. Moreover, the Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) model and Evolution Strategies(ES) are used to optimize transmission rates of infection and other model parameters, respectively. The experimental results on epidemic data from various Indian states demonstrate that persons infected with coronavirus had a more significant infection rate within four to nine days after infection, which corresponds to the actual transmission laws of the epidemic. The experimental results show that the proposed model has good prediction ability and obtains the Mean Absolute Percentage Error(MAPE) of 0.875\%, 0.965\%, 0.298\%, and 0.215\% for the next eight days in Maharashtra, Kerala, Karnataka, and Delhi, respectively. Our findings highlight the significance of using vaccination data, COVID-19-related posts, and information generated by the government's tremendous efforts in the prediction calculation process.},

The multimodal data, including disease-related data and migration information, are used to model the impact of social contact on disease transmission. The proposed model not only predicts the number of confirmed cases, but also estimates the number of infected cases. We evaluate the proposed model on the COVID-19 datasets from India, Austria, and Indonesia. In terms of predicting the number of confirmed cases, our model outperforms the latest epidemiological modeling methods, such as vSIR, and intelligent algorithms, such as LSTM, for both short-term and long-term predictions, which shows the superiority of bio-inspired intelligent algorithms. In general, the use of mobility information improves the prediction accuracy of the model.

But, FL suffers in distributing the global model, due to the heterogeneity of local data distributions. To overcome this issue, personalized models can be learned by using Federated multitask learning(FMTL). Due to the heterogeneous data from distributed environment, we propose a personalized model learned by federated multitask learning (FMTL) to predict the updated infection rate of COVID-19 in the USA using a mobility-based SEIR model. Furthermore, using a mobility-based SEIR model with an additional constraint we can analyze the availability of beds. We have used the real-time mobility data sets in various states of the USA during the years 2020 and 2021. We have chosen five states for the study and we observe that there exists a correlation among the number of COVID-19 infected cases even though the rate of spread in each case is different. We have considered each US state as a node in the federated learning environment and a linear regression model is built at each node. Our experimental results show that the root-mean-square percentage error for the actual and prediction of COVID-19 cases is low for Colorado state and high for Minnesota state. Using a mobility-based SEIR simulation model, we conclude that it will take at least 400 days to reach extinction when there is no proper vaccination or social distance.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/abstract{\textgreater}},

Policymakers need data-driven evidence to guide the relaxation with adaptive NPIs that consider the risk of both COVID-19 and other RIDs outbreaks, as well as the available healthcare resources.Combining the COVID-19 data of the sixth wave in Hong Kong between May 31, 2022 and August 28, 2022, 6-year epidemic data of other RIDs (2014–2019), and the healthcare resources data, we constructed compartment models to predict the epidemic curves of RIDs after the COVID-19-targeted NPIs. A deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model was developed to learn the optimal adaptive NPIs strategies to mitigate the outbreak of RIDs after COVID-19-targeted NPIs are lifted with minimal health and economic cost. The performance was validated by simulations of 1000 days starting August 29, 2022. We also extended the model to Beijing context.Without any NPIs, Hong Kong experienced a major COVID-19 resurgence far exceeding the hospital bed capacity. Simulation results showed that the proposed DRL-based adaptive NPIs successfully suppressed the outbreak of COVID-19 and other RIDs to lower than capacity. DRL carefully controlled the epidemic curve to be close to the full capacity so that herd immunity can be reached in a relatively short period with minimal cost. DRL derived more stringent adaptive NPIs in Beijing.DRL is a feasible method to identify the optimal adaptive NPIs that lead to minimal health and economic cost by facilitating gradual herd immunity of COVID-19 and mitigating the other RIDs outbreaks without overwhelming the hospitals.

	abstract = {Sequential decision-making under cost-sensitive tasks is prohibitively daunting, especially for the problem that has a significant impact on people's daily lives, such as malaria control, treatment recommendation. The main challenge faced by policymakers is to learn a policy from scratch by interacting with a complex environment in a few trials. This work introduces a practical, data-efficient policy learning method, named Variance-Bonus Monte Carlo Tree Search{\textasciitilde}(VB-MCTS), which can copy with very little data and facilitate learning from scratch in only a few trials. Specifically, the solution is a model-based reinforcement learning method. To avoid model bias, we apply Gaussian Process{\textasciitilde}(GP) regression to estimate the transitions explicitly. With the GP world model, we propose a variance-bonus reward to measure the uncertainty about the world. Adding the reward to the planning with MCTS can result in more efficient and effective exploration. Furthermore, the derived polynomial sample complexity indicates that VB-MCTS is sample efficient. Finally, outstanding performance on a competitive world-level RL competition and extensive experimental results verify its advantage over the state-of-the-art on the challenging malaria control task.},

Preventing the spread of viruses and mitigating their adverse societal and economic effects are major challenges facing all institutions in society. When reacting to events occurring in real-time, approaches based on human decision-making systems usually encounter difficulties in sorting out the most efficient mitigation strategies. In this paper, we present the framework for a real-time data-driven decision support tool for policymakers. Our framework is based on a reinforcement learning algorithm meant to optimize governmental responses to the state of the epidemic at each time-step. This framework adapts to changes in epidemic-spread given the advances in disease treatment methods and public health interventions. The mitigation strategy is adjusted based on the government’s priorities in a specific region. Our model is validated based on the COVID-19 data collected from New York state, USA.},

In this paper, we propose a solution for the life-or-economy dilemma that does not require private data. We bypass the private-data requirement by suppressing epidemic transmission through a dynamic control on inter-regional mobility that only relies on Origin-Designation (OD) data. We develop DUal-objective Reinforcement-Learning Epidemic Control Agent (DURLECA) to search mobility-control policies that can simultaneously minimize infection spread and maximally retain mobility. DURLECA hires a novel graph neural network, namely Flow-GNN, to estimate the virus-transmission risk induced by urban mobility. The estimated risk is used to support a reinforcement learning agent to generate mobility-control actions. The training of DURLECA is guided with a well-constructed reward function, which captures the natural trade-off relation between epidemic control and mobility retaining. Besides, we design two exploration strategies to improve the agent's searching efficiency and help it get rid of local optimums. Extensive experimental results on a real-world OD dataset show that DURLECA is able to suppress infections at an extremely low level while retaining 76{\textbackslash}\% of the mobility in the city. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/anyleopeace/DURLECA/.},

Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the control actions that are optimal, on average, over all possible epidemics are also best for each possible epidemic. Reinforcement learning (RL) and Monte Carlo control have been used to develop machine-readable context-dependent solutions for complex problems with many possible realizations ranging from video-games to the game of Go. RL could be a valuable tool to generate context-dependent policies for outbreak response, though translating the resulting policies into simple rules that can be read and interpreted by human decision-makers remains a challenge. Here we illustrate the application of RL to the development of context-dependent outbreak response policies to minimize outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease. We show that control based on the resulting context-dependent policies, which adapt interventions to the specific outbreak, result in smaller outbreaks than static policies. We further illustrate two approaches for translating the complex machine-readable policies into simple heuristics that can be evaluated by human decision-makers.

            Pandemic defines the global outbreak of a disease having a high transmission rate. The impact of a pandemic situation can be lessened by restricting the movement of the mass. However, one of its concomitant circumstances is an economic crisis. In this article, we demonstrate what actions an agent (trained using reinforcement learning) may take in different possible scenarios of a pandemic depending on the spread of disease and economic factors. To train the agent, we design a virtual pandemic scenario closely related to the present COVID-19 crisis. Then, we apply reinforcement learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, that deals with how an individual (human/machine) should interact on an environment (real/virtual) to achieve the cherished goal. Finally, we demonstrate what optimal actions the agent perform to reduce the spread of disease while considering the economic factors. In our experiment, we let the agent find an optimal solution without providing any prior knowledge. After training, we observed that the agent places a long length lockdown to reduce the first surge of a disease. Furthermore, the agent places a combination of cyclic lockdowns and short length lockdowns to halt the resurgence of the disease. Analyzing the agent’s performed actions, we discover that the agent decides movement restrictions not only based on the number of the infectious population but also considering the reproduction rate of the disease. The estimation and policy of the agent may improve the human-strategy of placing lockdown so that an economic crisis may be avoided while mitigating an infectious disease.},

Therefore, efficient vaccine allocation strategies are urgently called for, especially in large-scale metropolis where uneven health risk is manifested in nearby neighborhoods. However, there exist several key challenges in solving this problem: (1) great complexity in the large scale scenario adds to the difficulty in experts' vaccine allocation decision making; (2) heterogeneous information from all aspects in the metropolis' contact network makes information utilization difficult in decision making; (3) when utilizing the strong decision-making ability of reinforcement learning (RL) to solve the problem, poor explainability limits the credibility of the RL strategies. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning enhanced experts method. We deal with the great complexity via a specially designed algorithm aggregating blocks in the metropolis into communities and we hierarchically integrate RL among the communities and experts solution within each community. We design a self-supervised contact network representation algorithm to fuse the heterogeneous information for efficient vaccine allocation decision making. We conduct extensive experiments in three metropolis with real-world data and prove that our method outperforms the best baseline, reducing 9.01\% infections and 12.27\% deaths.We further demonstrate the explainability of the RL model, adding to its credibility and also enlightening the experts in turn.},

Firstly, we construct a new epidemiological meta-population model, with \$\$379\$\$379patches (one for each administrative district in Great Britain), that adequately captures the infection process of pandemic influenza. Our model balances complexity and computational efficiency such that the use of reinforcement learning techniques becomes attainable. Secondly, we set up a ground truth such that we can evaluate the performance of the “Proximal Policy Optimization” algorithm to learn in a single district of this epidemiological model. Finally, we consider a large-scale problem, by conducting an experiment where we aim to learn a joint policy to control the districts in a community of 11 tightly coupled districts, for which no ground truth can be established. This experiment shows that deep reinforcement learning can be used to learn mitigation policies in complex epidemiological models with a large state and action space.},

An optimal allocation strategy, especially in countries with access inequities and temporal separation of hot-spots, might be an effective way of halting the disease spread. We approach this problem by proposing a novel pipeline VacSIM that dovetails Deep Reinforcement Learning models into a Contextual Bandits approach for optimizing the distribution of COVID-19 vaccine. Whereas the Reinforcement Learning models suggest better actions and rewards, Contextual Bandits allow online modifications that may need to be implemented on a day-to-day basis in the real world scenario. We evaluate this framework against a naive allocation approach of distributing vaccine proportional to the incidence of COVID-19 cases in five different States across India (Assam, Delhi, Jharkhand, Maharashtra and Nagaland) and demonstrate up to 9039 potential infections prevented and a significant increase in the efficacy of limiting the spread over a period of 45 days through the VacSIM approach. Our models and the platform are extensible to all states of India and potentially across the globe. We also propose novel evaluation strategies including standard compartmental model-based projections and a causality-preserving evaluation of our model. Since all models carry assumptions that may need to be tested in various contexts, we open source our model VacSIM and contribute a new reinforcement learning environment compatible with OpenAI gym to make it extensible for real-world applications across the globe. 22http://vacsim.tavlab.iiitd.edu.in:8000/.},

An optimal plan will curb an epidemic with minimal loss of life, disease burden, and economic cost. Finding an optimal plan is an intractable computational problem in realistic settings. Policy-makers, however, would greatly benefit from tools that can efficiently search for plans that minimize disease and economic costs especially when considering multiple possible interventions over a continuous and complex action space given a continuous and equally complex state space. We formulate this problem as a Markov decision process. Our formulation is unique in its ability to represent multiple continuous interventions over any disease model defined by ordinary differential equations. We illustrate how to effectively apply state-of-the-art actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithms (PPO and SAC) to search for plans that minimize overall costs. We empirically evaluate the learning performance of these algorithms and compare their performance to hand-crafted baselines that mimic plans constructed by policy-makers. Our method outperforms baselines. Our work confirms the viability of a computational approach to support policy-makers},

	abstract = {COVID-19 has impacted nations differently based on their policy implementations. The effective policy requires taking into account public information and adaptability to new knowledge. Epidemiological models built to understand COVID-19 seldom provide the policymaker with the capability for adaptive pandemic control (APC). Among the core challenges to be overcome include (a) inability to handle a high degree of non-homogeneity in different contributing features across the pandemic timeline, (b) lack of an approach that enables adaptive incorporation of public health expert knowledge, and (c) transparent models that enable understanding of the decision-making process in suggesting policy. In this work, we take the early steps to address these challenges using Knowledge Infused Policy Gradient (KIPG) methods. Prior work on knowledge infusion does not handle soft and hard imposition of varying forms of knowledge in disease information and guidelines to necessarily comply with. Furthermore, the models do not attend to non-homogeneity in feature counts, manifesting as partial observability in informing the policy. Additionally, interpretable structures are extracted post-learning instead of learning an interpretable model required for APC. To this end, we introduce a mathematical framework for KIPG methods that can (a) induce relevant feature counts over multi-relational features of the world, (b) handle latent non-homogeneous counts as hidden variables that are linear combinations of kernelized aggregates over the features, and (b) infuse knowledge as functional constraints in a principled manner. The study establishes a theory for imposing hard and soft constraints and simulates it through experiments. In comparison with knowledge-intensive baselines, we show quick sample efficient adaptation to new knowledge and interpretability in the learned policy, especially in a pandemic context.},

	abstract = {Modeling the dynamics of epidemics helps to propose control strategies based on pharmaceuticaland non-pharmaceutical interventions (contact limitation, lockdown, vaccination,etc). Hand-designing such strategies is not trivial because of the number of possibleinterventions and the difficulty to predict long-term effects. This task can be cast as an optimization problem where state-of-the-art machine learning methods such as deep reinforcement learning might bring significant value. However, the specificity of each domain{\textbar}epidemic modeling or solving optimization problems{\textbar}requires strong collaborationsbetween researchers from different fields of expertise. This is why we introduce EpidemiOptim, a Python toolbox that facilitates collaborations between researchers inepidemiology and optimization. EpidemiOptim turns epidemiological models and cost functions into optimization problems via a standard interface commonly used by optimization practitioners (OpenAI Gym). Reinforcement learning algorithms based on QLearning with deep neural networks (DQN) and evolutionary algorithms (NSGA-II) are already implemented. We illustrate the use of EpidemiOptim to find optimal policies fordynamical on-o  lockdown control under the optimization of the death toll and economic recess using a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model for COVID-19. Using EpidemiOptim and its interactive visualization platform in Jupyter notebooks, epidemiologists, optimization practitioners and others (e.g. economists) can easily compare epidemiological models, costs functions and optimization algorithms to address important choicesto be made by health decision-makers. Trained models can be explored by experts and non-experts via a web interface.

As a result, governments around the world have been faced with the challenge of protecting public health while keeping the economy running to the greatest extent possible. Epidemiological models provide insight into the spread of these types of diseases and predict the effects of possible intervention policies. However, to date, even the most data-driven intervention policies rely on heuristics. In this paper, we study how reinforcement learning (RL) and Bayesian inference can be used to optimize mitigation policies that minimize economic impact without overwhelming hospital capacity. Our main contributions are (1) a novel agent-based pandemic simulator which, unlike traditional models, is able to model fine-grained interactions among people at specific locations in a community; (2) an RLbased methodology for optimizing fine-grained mitigation policies within this simulator; and (3) a Hidden Markov Model for predicting infected individuals based on partial observations regarding test results, presence of symptoms, and past physical contacts.

	abstract = {Controlling recurrent infectious diseases is a vital yet complicated problem. A large portion of the controlling epidemic relies on patients visit clinics voluntarily. However, they may already transmit the disease to their contacts by the time they feel sick enough to visit the clinic, especially for conditions with a long incubation period. Therefore, active screening/case finding was deployed to provide a powerful yet expensive means to control disease spread in recent years. To make active screening success a given limit budget, one of the challenges that need to be addressed is that we do not know the exact state of each patient. Given the number of horizon and budget we have in each time step, we also need to plan our screening efficiently and screening the vital patients in time. Thus, we apply a reinforcement learning approach to solve active screening problems on the network SIS disease model. The first contribution of this work is that we identify three significant challenges in active screening problems: partially observable states, combinatorial action choice, high-dimensional state-action space. We further propose the corresponding solutions to overcome these challenges. Specifically, we resolve the issue of high-dimensional state-action space by encoding the actions and partially observable states into a lower dimension form, which is done by either manually, using domain expertise, or automatically, using the state of the art GCN approach. We show that our approach can scale up to large graphs and perform decently compared to other baselines of previous literature and current practice.},

	abstract = {Vaccination has been the most promising hope to get back to normal ever since the COVID-19 outbreak started. But as promising as this sounds, vaccinating all of the population at the same time is practically infeasible because of the limited supply of vaccines from one side and the high demand from the other side. So, the process cannot happen overnight, and this is why governments kept thinking about how they can distribute vaccines in a way that helps their citizens get back to normal with the least possible damages (infections and deaths). In this study, we investigate how Reinforcement Learning (RL) can be used to distribute vaccines more efficiently among the citizens of a country, given their age and profession. For this reason, we created an RL agent that learns vaccine distribution strategies through its interaction with a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation environment that we built. This environment runs an Agent-Based Model (ABM) where we have agents interacting with each other and with the environment where they live and based on their behavior, the virus will spread. The goal of the RL agent was to find vaccine distribution strategies that would minimize the number of infections and deaths in the environment where our agents live. After training our RL agent for 100 episodes, we compared the best strategy that RL gave us with some of the well-known strategies that countries adopt, and we found that the RL strategy outperformed them.},

COVID-19 reminded constituents over the world that government decision-making could change their lives. During the COVID-19 pandemic, governments were concerned with reducing fatalities as the virus spread but at the same time also maintaining a flowing economy. In this paper, we address epidemic decision-making regarding the interventions necessary given of the epidemic based on the purpose of the decision-maker. Further, we intend to compare different vaccination strategies, such as age-based and random vaccination, to shine a light on who should get priority in the vaccination process. To address these issues, we propose a simulation-deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework. This framework is composed of an agent-based simulation model and a governor DRL agent that can enforce interventions in the agent-based simulation environment. Computational results show that our DRL agent can learn effective strategies and suggest optimal actions given a specific epidemic situation based on a multi-objective reward structure. We compare our DRL agent's decisions to government interventions at different periods of time during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results suggest that more could have been done to control the epidemic. In addition, if a random vaccination strategy that allows super-spreaders to get vaccinated early were used, infections would have been reduced by 32\% at the expense of 4\% more deaths. We also show that a behavioral change of fully quarantining 10\% of the risky individuals and using a random vaccination strategy leads to a reduction of the death toll by 14\% and 27\% compared to the age-based vaccination strategy that was implemented and the New Jersey reported data, respectively. We have also demonstrated the flexibility of our approach to be applied to other locations by validating and applying our model to the COVID-19 case in the state of Kansas.},

	abstract = {Background
Policy makers are facing more complicated challenges to balance saving lives and economic development in the post-vaccination era during a pandemic. Epidemic simulation models and pandemic control methods are designed to tackle this problem. However, most of the existing approaches cannot be applied to real-world cases due to the lack of adaptability to new scenarios and micro representational ability (especially for system dynamics models), the huge computation demand, and the inefficient use of historical information.
Methods
We propose a novel Pandemic Control decision making framework via large-scale Agent-based modeling and deep Reinforcement learning (PaCAR) to search optimal control policies that can simultaneously minimize the spread of infection and the government restrictions. In the framework, we develop a new large-scale agent-based simulator with vaccine settings implemented to be calibrated and serve as a realistic environment for a city or a state. We also design a novel reinforcement learning architecture applicable to the pandemic control problem, with a reward carefully designed by the net monetary benefit framework and a sequence learning network to extract information from the sequential epidemiological observations, such as number of cases, vaccination, and so forth.
Results
Our approach outperforms the baselines designed by experts or adopted by real-world governments and is flexible in dealing with different variants, such as Alpha and Delta in COVID-19. PaCAR succeeds in controlling the pandemic with the lowest economic costs and relatively short epidemic duration and few cases. We further conduct extensive experiments to analyze the reasoning behind the resulting policy sequence and try to conclude this as an informative reference for policy makers in the post-vaccination era of COVID-19 and beyond.
Limitations
The modeling of economic costs, which are directly estimated by the level of government restrictions, is rather simple. This article mainly focuses on several specific control methods and single-wave pandemic control.
Conclusions
The proposed framework PaCAR can offer adaptive pandemic control recommendations on different variants and population sizes. Intelligent pandemic control empowered by artificial intelligence may help us make it through the current COVID-19 and other possible pandemics in the future with less cost both of lives and economy.
Highlights
•	
We introduce a new efficient, large-scale agent-based epidemic simulator in our framework PaCAR, which can be applied to train reinforcement learning networks in a real-world scenario with a population of more than 10,000,000.
•	
We develop a novel learning mechanism in PaCAR, which augments reinforcement learning with sequence learning, to learn the tradeoff policy decision of saving lives and economic development in the post-vaccination era.
•	
We demonstrate that the policy learned by PaCAR outperforms different benchmark policies under various reality conditions during COVID-19.
•	
We analyze the resulting policy given by PaCAR, and the lessons may shed light on better pandemic preparedness plans in the future.},

	abstract = {At present, the global COVID-19 is still severe. More and more countries have experienced second or even third outbreaks. The epidemic is far from over until the vaccine is successfully developed and put on the market on a large scale. Inappropriate epidemic control strategies may bring catastrophic consequences. It is essential to maximize the epidemic restraining and to mitigate economic damage. However, the study on the optimal control strategy concerning both sides is rare, and no optimal model has been built. In this paper, the Susceptible-Infectious-Hospitalized-Recovered (SIHR) compartment model is expanded to simulate the epidemic’s spread concerning isolation rate. An economic model affected by epidemic isolation measures is established. The effective reproduction number and the eigenvalues at the equilibrium point are introduced as the indicators of controllability and stability of the model and verified the effectiveness of the SIHR model. Based on the Deep Q Network (DQN), one of the deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods, the blocking policy is studied to maximize the economic output under the premise of controlling the number of infections in different stages. The epidemic control strategies given by deep RL under different learning strategies are compared for different reward coefficients. The study demonstrates that optimal policies may differ in various countries depending on disease spread and anti-economic risk ability. The results show that the more economical strategy, the less economic loss in the short term, which can save economically fragile countries from economic crises. In the second or third outbreak stage, the earlier the government adopts the control strategy, the smaller the economic loss. We recommend the method of deep RL to specify a policy which can control the epidemic while making quarantine economically viable.},

Stringent control measures, such as school closures and stay-at-home orders, while having significant effects, also bring huge economic losses. In the face of an emerging infectious disease, a crucial question for policymakers is how to make the trade-off and implement the appropriate interventions timely given the huge uncertainty. In this work, we propose a Multi-Objective Model-based Reinforcement Learning framework to facilitate data-driven decision-making and minimize the overall long-term cost. Specifically, at each decision point, a Bayesian epidemiological model is first learned as the environment model, and then the proposed model-based multi-objective planning algorithm is applied to find a set of Pareto-optimal policies. This framework, combined with the prediction bands for each policy, provides a real-time decision support tool for policymakers.

A restrictive approach can seriously damage the economy. Conversely, a relaxed one may put at risk a high percentage of the population. Other investigations in this area are focused on modelling the spread of the virus or estimating the impact of the different measures on its propagation. However, in this paper, we propose a new methodology for helping governments in planning the phases to combat the pandemic based on their priorities. To this end, we implement the SEIR epidemiological model to represent the evolution of the COVID-19 virus on the population. To optimize the best sequences of actions governments can take, we propose a methodology with two approaches, one based on Deep Q-Learning and another one based on Genetic Algorithms. The sequences of actions (confinement, self-isolation, two-meter distance or not taking restrictions) are evaluated according to a reward system focused on meeting two objectives: firstly, getting few people infected so that hospitals are not overwhelmed, and secondly, avoiding taking drastic measures which could cause serious damage to the economy. The conducted experiments evaluate our methodology based on the accumulated rewards during the established period. The experiments also prove that it is a valid tool for governments to reduce the negative effects of a pandemic by optimizing the planning of the phases. According to our results, the approach based on Deep Q-Learning outperforms the one based on Genetic Algorithms.},

In this context, the contribution of vaccines to the continued economic and social prosperity of humanity is enormous, but it is constantly threatened by the development of vaccine-resistant strains of the pathogen. In this study, we investigate the usage of genomic sequencing tests to detect new strains of a pathogen in a multi-strain pandemic scenario using a mathematical–epidemiological–genomic–economic model. Our model provides a theoretical framework to explore the influence of an extensive number of pharmaceutical interventions in a dynamic multi-strain pandemic. Specifically, we show that while a genomic sequence testing policy can be both economically and epidemiologically efficient, a random sample of the population provides sub-optimal results. Moreover, we demonstrate that the optimal policy is sensitive to the social and economic settings of the population, and provide a machine learning based model that offers a solution to these challenges.},

	abstract = {The rapid spread of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) poses an unprecedented threat to the public health system and social economy, with approximately 500 million confirmed cases worldwide. Policymakers confront with high-stakes to make a decision on interventions to prevent the pandemic from further spreading, which is a dilemma between public health and a steady economy. However, the epidemic control problem has vast solution space and its internal dynamic is driven by population mobility, which makes it difficult for policymakers to find the optimal intervention strategy based on rules-of-thumb. In this paper, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning enabled Epidemic Control framework (DRL-EC) to make a decision on intervention to effectively alleviate the impacts of the epidemic outbreaks. Specifically, it is driven by reinforcement learning to learn the intervention policy autonomously for the policymaker, which can be adaptive to the various epidemic situation. Furthermore, District-Coupled Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (DC-SEIR) model is hired to simulate the pandemic transmission between inter-district, which characterize the spatial and temporal nature of infectious disease transmission simultaneously. Extensive experimental results on a real-world dataset, the Omicron local outbreaks in China, demonstrate the superiority of the DRL-EC compared with the strategy based on rules-of-thumb.},

Within our framework, we find that optimal intervention policies first target high-degree nodes before shifting to lower-degree nodes in a time-dependent manner.

Diagnosis and treatment are two most effective interventions, and thus, identifying corresponding optimal combinations of testing and retention-in-care rates would help inform implementation of relevant programs. Considering the dynamic and stochastic complexity of the disease and the time dynamics of decision-making, solving for optimal combinations using commonly used methods of parametric optimization or exhaustive evaluation of pre-selected options are infeasible. Reinforcement learning (RL), an artificial intelligence method, is ideal; however, training RL algorithms and ensuring convergence to optimality are computationally challenging for large-scale stochastic problems. We evaluate its feasibility in the context of the EHE goal. We trained an RL algorithm to identify a 'sequence' of combinations of HIV-testing and retention-in-care rates at 5-year intervals over 2015-2070 that optimally leads towards HIV elimination. We defined optimality as a sequence that maximizes quality-adjusted-life-years lived and minimizes HIV-testing and care-and-treatment costs. We show that solving for testing and retention-in-care rates through appropriate reformulation using proxy decision-metrics overcomes the computational challenges of RL. We used a stochastic agent-based simulation to train the RL algorithm. As there is variability in support-programs needed to address barriers to care-access, we evaluated the sensitivity of optimal decisions to three cost-functions. The model suggests to scale-up retention-in-care programs to achieve and maintain high annual retention-rates while initiating with a high testing-frequency but relaxing it over a 10-year period as incidence decreases. Results were mainly robust to the uncertainty in costs. However, testing and retention-in-care alone did not achieve the 2030 EHE targets, suggesting the need for additional interventions. The results from the model demonstrated convergence. RL is suitable for evaluating phased public health decisions for infectious disease control.},

Because of their rapid development and huge impact, laying out interventions becomes one of the most critical paths for policymakers to respond to the epidemic. However, the existing studies mainly focus on epidemic control with a single intervention, which makes the epidemic control effectiveness severely compromised. In view of this, we propose a Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning decision framework for multi-mode Epidemic Control with multiple interventions called HRL4EC. We devise an epidemiological model, referred to as MID-SEIR, to describe multiple interventions' impact on transmission explicitly, and use it as the environment for HRL4EC. Besides, to address the complexity introduced by multiple interventions, this work transforms the multi-mode intervention decision problem into a multi-level control problem, and employs hierarchical reinforcement learning to find the optimal strategies. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted with real and simulated epidemic data to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. We further analyze the experiment data in-depth, conclude a series of findings on epidemic intervention strategies, and make a visualization accordingly, which can provide heuristic support for policymakers' pandemic response.},

We describe a general framework aimed to derive adaptive cost-effective interventions, adequate for both recent and emerging pandemic threats. We also quantify the net health benefits and propose a reinforcement learning approach to optimise adaptive NPIs. The approach utilises an agent-based model simulating pandemic responses in Australia, and accounts for a heterogeneous population with variable levels of compliance fluctuating over time and across individuals. Our analysis shows that a significant net health benefit may be attained by adaptive NPIs formed by partial social distancing measures, coupled with moderate levels of the society’s willingness to pay for health gains (health losses averted). We demonstrate that a socially acceptable balance between health effects and incurred economic costs is achievable over a long term, despite possible early setbacks.},

            Modelling epidemics using classical population‐based models suffers from shortcomings that so‐called individual‐based models are able to overcome, as they are able to take into account heterogeneity features, such as super‐spreaders, and describe the dynamics involved in small clusters. In return, such models often involve large graphs which are expensive to simulate and difficult to optimize, both in theory and in practice. By combining the reinforcement learning philosophy with reduced models, we propose a numerical approach to determine optimal health policies for a stochastic individual‐based model taking into account heterogeneity in the population. More precisely, we introduce a deterministic reduced population‐based model involving a neural network, designed to faithfully mimic the local dynamics of the more complex individual‐based model. Then the optimal control is determined by sequentially training the network until an optimal strategy for the population‐based model succeeds in also containing the epidemic when simulated on the individual‐based model. After describing the practical implementation of the method, several numerical tests are proposed to demonstrate its ability to determine controls for models with contact heterogeneity.},

Fortunately, Spatio-temporal processes bear essential importance in many applied scientific fields. And the disease pandemic can be viewed as Spatio-temporal dynamics processes. Generally, partial differential equations (PDEs) have been widely used to investigate interfacial dynamic processes. In this work, we use a physical-constraint neural network learning the Spatio-temporal mean-field dynamics to control the propagation of epidemics. Also, we use the AI-based algorithm physical-constraint learning (PCL) to solve the minimization problems of the mean-field game (MFG) and control (MFC) problems instead of the traditional computational method. In PCL, the PDEs are encoded into the loss function, where partial derivatives can be obtained through automatic differentiation (AD). We demonstrate how they can be applied in practice by considering the problem of controlling the propagation of epidemics. Numerical experiments on different input data are implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed models compared to the state-of-the-art approach and illustrate how to separate the infected patients in a spatial domain effectively.},

	abstract = {Epidemic monitoring systems engaged in accurate discovery of infected individuals enable better understanding of the dynamics of epidemics and thus may promote effective disease mitigation or prevention. Currently, infection discovery systems require either physical participation of potential patients or provision of information from hospitals and health-care services. While social media has emerged as an increasingly important knowledge source that reflects multiple real world events, there is only a small literature examining how social media information can be incorporated into computational epidemic models. In this paper, we demonstrate how social media information can be incorporated into and improve upon traditional techniques used to model the dynamics of infectious diseases. Using flu infection histories and social network data collected from 264 students in a college community, we identify social network signals that can aid identification of infected individuals. Extending the traditional SIRS model, we introduce and illustrate the efficacy of an Online-Interaction-Aware Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible (OIA-SIRS) model based on four social network signals for modeling infection dynamics. Empirical evaluations of our case study, flu infection within a college community, reveal that the OIA-SIRS model is more accurate than the traditional model, and also closely tracks the real-world infection rates as reported by CDC ILINet and Google Flu Trend.},

	abstract = {The emergence of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) generated a need to quickly and accurately assemble up-to-date information related to its spread. In this research article, we propose two methods in which Twitter is useful when modelling the spread of COVID-19: (1) machine learning algorithms trained in English, Spanish, German, Portuguese and Italian are used to identify symptomatic individuals derived from Twitter. Using the geo-location attached to each tweet, we map users to a geographic location to produce a time-series of potential symptomatic individuals. We calibrate an extended SEIRD epidemiological model with combinations of low-latency data feeds, including the symptomatic tweets, with death data and infer the parameters of the model. We then evaluate the usefulness of the data feeds when making predictions of daily deaths in 50 US States, 16 Latin American countries, 2 European countries and 7 NHS (National Health Service) regions in the UK. We show that using symptomatic tweets can result in a 6\% and 17\% increase in mean squared error accuracy, on average, when predicting COVID-19 deaths in US States and the rest of the world, respectively, compared to using solely death data. (2) Origin/destination (O/D) matrices, for movements between seven NHS regions, are constructed by determining when a user has tweeted twice in a 24 h period in two different locations. We show that increasing and decreasing a social connectivity parameter within an SIR model affects the rate of spread of a disease.},

Within the USA, public health surveillance systems collect and distribute near real-time weekly hospitalization rates, a key observational metric that makes real-time forecast of this outcome possible. In this paper, we describe a method to forecast hospitalization rates using a population level transmission model in combination with a data assimilation technique. Using this method, we generated retrospective forecasts of hospitalization rates for five age groups and the overall population during five seasons in the USA and quantified forecast accuracy for both near-term and seasonal targets. Additionally, we describe methods to correct for under-reporting of hospitalization rates (backcast) and to estimate hospitalization rates from publicly available online search trends data (nowcast). Forecasts based on surveillance rates alone were reasonably accurate in predicting peak hospitalization rates (within ± 25\% of the actual peak rate, three weeks before peak). The error in predicting rates one to four weeks ahead, remained constant for the duration of the seasons, even during periods of increased influenza incidence. An improvement in forecast quality across all age groups, seasons and targets was observed when backcasts and nowcasts supplemented surveillance data. These results suggest that the model-inference framework can provide reasonably accurate real-time forecasts of influenza hospitalizations; backcasts and nowcasts offer a way to improve system tolerance to observational errors.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
          Timely, high-resolution forecasts of infectious disease incidence are useful for policy makers in deciding intervention measures and estimating healthcare resource burden. In this paper, we consider the task of forecasting COVID-19 confirmed cases at the county level for the United States. Although multiple methods have been explored for this task, their performance has varied across space and time due to noisy data and the inherent dynamic nature of the pandemic. We present a forecasting pipeline which incorporates probabilistic forecasts from multiple statistical, machine learning and mechanistic methods through a Bayesian ensembling scheme, and has been operational for nearly 6 months serving local, state and federal policymakers in the United States. While showing that the Bayesian ensemble is at least as good as the individual methods, we also show that each individual method contributes significantly for different spatial regions and time points. We compare our model’s performance with other similar models being integrated into CDC-initiated COVID-19 Forecast Hub, and show better performance at longer forecast horizons. Finally, we also describe how such forecasts are used to increase lead time for training mechanistic scenario projections. Our work demonstrates that such a real-time high resolution forecasting pipeline can be developed by integrating multiple methods within a performance-based ensemble to support pandemic response.

Mechanistic approaches such as Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) models have traditionally been used to achieve this objective. However, formulating such models is challenged by the necessity to formulate equations for plausible causal mechanisms between the intensity of COVID-19 transmission and external epidemic drivers such as temperature, and the stringency of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Here, we combined a neural network model (NN) with a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered model (SEIR) in a hybrid model and attempted to increase the prediction accuracy of existing models used to forecast ICU occupancy.

At the cantonal and hospital levels, the reduction on the forecast’s mean absolute error were 46\% and 50\%, respectively. Our findings illustrate those predictions from hybrid model can be used to anticipate occupancy in ICU, and support the decision-making for lifesaving actions such as the transfer of patients and dispatching of medical personnel and ventilators.},

    abstract = {Inferring epidemiological parameters such as the R0 from time-scaled phylogenies is a timely challenge. Most current approaches rely on likelihood functions, which raise specific issues that range from computing these functions to finding their maxima numerically. Here, we present a new regression-based Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) approach, which we base on a large variety of summary statistics intended to capture the information contained in the phylogeny and its corresponding lineage-through-time plot. The regression step involves the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method, which is a robust machine learning technique. It allows us to readily deal with the large number of summary statistics, while avoiding resorting to Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. To compare our approach to existing ones, we simulated target trees under a variety of epidemiological models and settings, and inferred parameters of interest using the same priors. We found that, for large phylogenies, the accuracy of our regression-ABC is comparable to that of likelihood-based approaches involving birth-death processes implemented in BEAST2. Our approach even outperformed these when inferring the host population size with a Susceptible-Infected-Removed epidemiological model. It also clearly outperformed a recent kernel-ABC approach when assuming a Susceptible-Infected epidemiological model with two host types. Lastly, by re-analyzing data from the early stages of the recent Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone, we showed that regression-ABC provides more realistic estimates for the duration parameters (latency and infectiousness) than the likelihood-based method. Overall, ABC based on a large variety of summary statistics and a regression method able to perform variable selection and avoid overfitting is a promising approach to analyze large phylogenies.},

abstract = {Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, universities are implementing various prevention and mitigation measures. Identifying and isolating infectious individuals by using screening testing is one such a measure that can contribute to reducing spread. Here, we propose a hybrid stochastic model for infectious disease transmission in a university campus with screening testing and its surrounding community. Based on a compartmental modeling strategy, this hybrid stochastic model represents the evolution of the infectious disease and its transmission using continuous-time stochastic dynamics, and it represents the screening testing as discrete stochastic events. We also develop, in a Bayesian framework, the identification of parameters of this hybrid stochastic model, including transmission rates. These parameters were identified from the screening test data for the university population and observed incidence counts for the surrounding community. We implement the exploration of the Bayesian posterior using a machine-learning simulation-based inference approach. The proposed methodology was applied in a retrospective modeling study of a massive COVID-19 screening conducted at the University of Liège in Fall 2020. The emphasis of the paper is on the development of the hybrid stochastic model to assess the impact of screening testing as a measure to reduce spread. The hybrid stochastic model allows various factors to be represented and examined, such as interplay with the surrounding community, variability of the transmission dynamics, the rate of participation in the screening testing, the test sensitivity, the test frequency, the diagnosis delay, and compliance with isolation. The application in the retrospective modeling study suggests that a high rate of participation and a high test frequency are important factors to reduce spread.}

abstract = {This paper reports a step towards the development of robotic systems capable of applying sensors to animals so that valuable information about their health and development can be obtained automatically. A vision guided robot has been designed to track a given position (the P2 position used for backfat measurement) on the body of a pig as it stands, loosely constrained, in a feeding stall. The vision guidance system was based on a model which predicted the P2 position from the positions of points on the periphery of plan view video images of the pig. A purpose built, two axis, SCARA robot with pneumatic actuation was developed. The tracking performance of the combined robot and image analysis system was evaluated by testing the ability of the robot to track recorded images of a pig moving around in a feeding stall, and by its ability to track live pigs in a field trial. The results showed that it should be feasible for a vision guided, pneumatic robot to track a moving pig and place an ultrasonic sensor at a target position on its back at a frequency which would enable useful data to be collected.}

We discuss the benefits and challenges of mechanistic epidemiological modelling for livestock enzootics, with particular emphasis on the need for interdisciplinary approaches. We focus on issues arising when modelling pathogen spread at various scales (from farm to the region) to better assess disease control and propose targeted options. We discuss in particular the inclusion of farmers’ strategic decision-making, the integration of within-host scale to refine intervention targeting, and the need to ground models on data.}

ABSTRACT = {Machine learning has emerged with big data technologies and high-performance computing to create new opportunities for data intensive science in the multi-disciplinary agri-technologies domain. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of research dedicated to applications of machine learning in agricultural production systems. The works analyzed were categorized in (a) crop management, including applications on yield prediction, disease detection, weed detection crop quality, and species recognition; (b) livestock management, including applications on animal welfare and livestock production; (c) water management; and (d) soil management. The filtering and classification of the presented articles demonstrate how agriculture will benefit from machine learning technologies. By applying machine learning to sensor data, farm management systems are evolving into real time artificial intelligence enabled programs that provide rich recommendations and insights for farmer decision support and action.},

abstract = {Bovine Respiratory Disease (BRD) results from a complex, multifactorial interaction of stressors, animal susceptibility, and respiratory pathogens. The infectious agents associated with BRD are ubiquitous among cattle populations. Typically, one or a combination of stressors are necessary to initiate BRD. Prevention of BRD should, therefore, address management procedures to minimise stressors. Administration of vaccines against BRD agents may help reduce the incidence of BRD but is unlikely to eliminate the condition. The effectiveness of antimicrobials in the treatment of BRD depends primarily on early recognition and treatment. The use of antioxidant vitamins, minerals or other agents in the prevention and treatment of BRD warrants further research.},

    abstract = { Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) diagnosis during the postweaning phase of beef production is an important component of effective preventive health and treatment programs. Although identification of diseased animals based on signs of clinical illness (CI) is a common method in the beef industry for identifying BRD, very little information is available on the accuracy of this method. Previous investigators hypothesized that monitoring pulmonary lesions at harvest (LU) could be a more reliable indicator of disease status during the postweaning phase. A structured literature review was conducted to identify research that compared CI and LU. Because there is no true gold standard for diagnosing BRD, Bayesian methods were used to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of each diagnostic method relative to a BRD diagnosis at any time during the postweaning phase. Results from the current study indicate that the estimated diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of CI were 61.8\% (97.5\% probability interval [PI]: 55.7, 68.4) and 62.8\% (97.5\% PI: 60.0, 65.7), respectively. Use of LU for a BRD diagnosis was estimated to have a sensitivity of 77.4\% (97.5\% PI: 66.2, 87.3) and a specificity of 89.7\% (97.5\% PI: 86.0, 93.8). Further analysis revealed that the probabilities of LU having higher sensitivity and specificity than CI were 99.4\% and 100\%, respectively. The present research indicates that neither method was perfect, and both methods were relatively poor at correctly classifying truly diseased animals (sensitivity) but that LU was more accurate than CI for BRD diagnosis. Results from the present study should be considered when these diagnostic methods are used to evaluate BRD outcomes in clinical and research settings. }

Twenty-four bulls received a bolus at entry and were observed for 40 days. As soon as a reticulo-rumen hyperthermia ({RH}) episode was detected using the bolus, clinical examination was performed by a veterinarian and then repeated every 12–24 h until the end of {RH} episode. Fifty-two {RH} episodes were detected in 22 animals. High rectal temperatures (40.1 ± 0.6 °C) were observed during these episodes. {BRD} was diagnosed on the basis of clinical examination during 38/52 {RH} episodes in 21 animals (positive predictive value 73\%). The onset of {BRD} signs always occurred after the onset of {RH} episodes, with a time-lag from 12 to 136 h, depending on {BRD} signs. Monitoring reticulo-rumen temperature permits early detection of {BRD}; however, clinical examination is required to conﬁrm {BRD}.},

ABSTRACT = {Accelerometers (ACL) can identify behavioral and activity changes in calves. In the present study, we examined the association between bovine respiratory disease (BRD) and behavioral changes detected by an ear-tag based ACL system in weaned dairy calves. Accelerometer data were analyzed from 7 d before to 1 d after clinical diagnosis of BRD. All calves in the study (n = 508) were checked daily by an adapted University of Wisconsin Calf Scoring System. Calves with a score ≥ 4 and fever for at least two consecutive days were categorized as diseased (DIS). The day of clinical diagnosis of BRD was defined as d 0. The data analysis showed a significant difference in high active times between DIS and healthy control calves (CON), with CON showing more high active times on every day, except d −3. Diseased calves showed significantly more inactive times on d −4, −2, and 0, as well as longer lying times on d −5, −2, and +1. These results indicate the potential of the ACL to detect BRD prior to a clinical diagnosis in group-housed calves. Furthermore, in this study, we described the ‘normal’ behavior in 428 clinically healthy weaned dairy calves obtained by the ACL system.},

	abstract = {Background: The diagnostic tools for bovine respiratory disease diagnosis include clinical inspection, thoracic auscultation, and ultrasonography. Hypothesis: Thoracic auscultation and clinical examination have limitations in the detection of lung consolidation in dairy calves. Animals: Prospective cohort of 106 preweaned calves from 13 diﬀerent dairy herds (10 with a history of active bovine respiratory disease ({BRD}) in calves and 3 without suspected {BRD} problems).
Methods: Each preweaned calf was clinically inspected using the Wisconsin calf respiratory scoring chart ({CRSC}) and treatment history was noted. Systematic thoracic auscultation and ultrasonography then were performed, the latter focusing on lung consolidation. Mortality was recorded over a 30-day period.
Results: A total of 56 of 106 calves had ultrasonographic evidence of lung consolidation. The sensitivity of thoracic auscultation to detect consolidation was 5.9\% (range, 0–16.7\%). Only 41.1\% (23/33) of calves with consolidated lungs had been treated previously by the producers. When adding {CRSC} and previous {BRD} treatment by the producer, sensitivity of detection increased to 71.4\% (40/56). The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was 0.809 (95\% {CI}, 0.721–0.879) for the number of areas within the lungs with consolidation and 0.743 (95\% {CI}, 0.648–0.823) for the maximal depth of consolidation as predictors of death within 1 month after examination. These were not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent (P = .06).
Conclusions and Clinical Importance: This study shows that thoracic auscultation is of limited value in diagnosing lung consolidation in calves. Ultrasonographic assessment of the thorax could be a useful tool to assess {BRD} detection eﬃciency on dairy farms.},
